			<p style="text-align:center">If you want to contribute to one of my repositories by making an issue or pull request, please read through these guidelines.</p>
			<h2>Issues</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Make your report as detailed as possible. Include both a description of the issue and, if possible, a list of steps to reproduce the issue.</li>
				<li>Your report should be written in coherent English.</li>
				<li>Avoid making duplicate issues. Check to make sure the issue you want to report hasn't been reported already.</li>
				<li>Avoid putting multiple, unrelated issues in one report. Make a separate report for each to help keep things organized.</li>
				<li>I will also accept non-issues such as feature requests or questions as long as they are directly related to the repo.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h2>Pull Requests</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Keep your pull requests lightweight and directed towards a single change. If you want to change or add multiple unrelated things, make separate pull requests for each of them.</li>
				<li>Extremely large changes or complete rewrites won't be accepted without prior discussion and approval.</li>
				<li>Use conventional programming methods. Try to avoid doing odd things that may leave me or other contributors confused, and add comments next to or above any code that might be confusing.</li>
				<li>Try to keep your formatting consistent with what's already written.</li>
				<li>Optimize your code as much as possible, but prioritize readability over micro-optimizations.</li>
				<li>Make sure everything works properly before submitting the PR. I will test it myself before accepting, but having it work the first time makes it easier for both of us.</li>
			</ul>
