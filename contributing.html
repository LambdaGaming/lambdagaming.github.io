			<p style="text-align:center">If you want to contribute to one of my repositories by making an issue or pull request, please read through the following.</p>
			<h2>Issues</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Issues can be in any format you'd like as long as they are readable and in English.</li>
				<li>Avoid making duplicate issues. Check to make sure the issue you want to report hasn't been reported already.</li>
				<li>Verify that the repository in question is directly responsible for your issue, and provide proof of this if possible.</li>
				<li>Also verify that you have correctly installed and/or configured the item that is causing the issue.</li>
				<li>I will also accept non-issues such as feature requests or questions as long as they are directly related to the repo.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h2>Pull Requests</h2>
			<h3>Required</h3>
			<p>These are the things I require when making a pull request. Not following all of them will likely result in rejection.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Keep your pull requests lightweight and directed towards a single change. If you want to change or add multiple unrelated things, make separate pull requests for each of them.</li>
				<li>Extremely large changes or complete rewrites won't be accepted unless you provide proof that the change greatly improves performance and/or functionality.</li>
				<li>Use conventional programming methods. Don't do odd things that may leave me or other contributors confused, and add comments next to or above any code that might be confusing.</li>
				<li>Make sure your code is readable and comprehendible. Group related chunks of code together and use appropriate names for functions, variables, namespaces, etc.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Recommended</h3>
			<p>These are things I recommend you do when making a pull request, but they are not required. They mostly consist of specific style preferences.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Use size 4 tabs instead of spaces.</li>
				<li>Place global variables, includes, usings, and similar things at the very top of the file whenever possible.</li>
				<li>Leave a single line of whitespace in between functions.</li>
				<li>Insert spaces after commas in function arguments, as well as in between non-empty parenthesis ( ) and angle brackets { }. Leave square brackets [ ] and arrows < > without spaces.</li>
				<li>Optimize your code as much as possible, but prioritize readability over micro-optimizations.</li>
				<li>Make sure everything works properly before submitting the PR. I will still personally test it before accepting, but having it work the first time makes it easier for both of us.</li>
			</ul>
