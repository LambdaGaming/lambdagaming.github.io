			<h2>OPGman's Contributing Guidelines</h2>
			<p>Thanks for contributing! Before you start, please read through the following guidelines. Be sure to also check the readme of the repo you're contributing to for any additional guidelines or restrictions. These are not strictly enforced, but not following them might increase the chances of your submission being rejected or ignored.</p>
			<h3>Note About AI</h3>
			<p>I do not accept issues or code that are written in whole or in part by generative AI, or any other type of automatic content generator. Please ensure that you are submitting your own work, and that you fully understand the content you are submitting. If I have reason to believe that any part of your submission violates this rule, it will be rejected, and you may be prohibited from contributing to any of my repos in the future.</p>
			<h3>Issues</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Make your report as detailed as possible. Include both a description of the issue and, if possible, a list of steps to reproduce it.</li>
				<li>Your report should be written in coherent English.</li>
				<li>Verify that the issue you're having hasn't been reported already.</li>
				<li>Make a separate report for each issue you have.</li>
				<li>I will also accept non-issues such as feature requests or questions as long as they are relevant to the repo.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Pull Requests</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Keep your pull requests simple and directed towards a single change. If you want to change or add multiple unrelated things, make separate pull requests for each of them.</li>
				<li>Any large changes you plan on making should be discussed with me ahead of time, to make sure it's something I'll accept and also not something that's already being working on.</li>
				<li>Use conventional programming methods. Try to avoid doing unusual things that might leave me or others confused, and add comments next to or above any code that might be confusing.</li>
				<li>Try to keep your formatting consistent with what's already written for the sake of readability.</li>
				<li>Optimize your code as much as possible, but prioritize readability over micro-optimizations.</li>
				<li>Make sure everything works properly before submitting the PR. I will test it myself before accepting, but having it work the first time makes it easier for both of us.</li>
			</ul>
