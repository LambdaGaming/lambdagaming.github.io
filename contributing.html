			<h2>OPGman's Contributing Guidelines</h2>
			<p>Thanks for being interested in contributing! Before you start, please read through the following guidelines. These apply to all of my repos, so they're pretty generic. Please be sure to also check the readme of the repo you're contributing to for any additional guidelines or restrictions. Note that these are <i>guidelines</i> and not rules. You don't <i>have</i> to follow each and every one of them, but I would appreciate it if you did. The only times I will outright reject a submission is if it looks like you went out of your way to not follow any of the guidelines, or the submission violates my policy on AI, which is described below.</p>
			<h3>AI Policy</h3>
			<p>When you submit an issue or pull request, I expect you to fully understand the content you're submitting. I don't care if you use AI as a tool to help you write something, but if it's clear that you're letting an AI do all the work and you have no idea what some or all of the things in the submission mean, it will be rejected without further discussion.</p>
			<h3>Issues</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Make your report as detailed as possible. Include both a description of the issue and, if possible, a list of steps to reproduce it.</li>
				<li>Your report should be written in coherent English.</li>
				<li>Verify that the issue you're having hasn't been reported already.</li>
				<li>Make a separate report for each issue you have.</li>
				<li>I will also accept non-issues such as feature requests or questions as long as they are relevant to the repo.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Pull Requests</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Keep your pull requests simple and directed towards a single change. If you want to change or add multiple unrelated things, make separate pull requests for each of them.</li>
				<li>Any large changes you plan on making should be discussed with me ahead of time, to make sure it's something I'll accept and also not something that's already being working on.</li>
				<li>Use conventional programming methods. Try to avoid doing unusual things that might leave me or others confused, and add comments next to or above any code that might be confusing.</li>
				<li>Try to keep your formatting consistent with what's already written for the sake of readability.</li>
				<li>Optimize your code as much as possible, but prioritize readability over micro-optimizations.</li>
				<li>Make sure everything works properly before submitting the PR. I will test it myself before accepting, but having it work the first time makes it easier for both of us.</li>
			</ul>
