			<h2>Contributing Guidelines</h2>
			<h3>Issues</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Make your report as detailed as possible. Include both a description of the issue and, if possible, a list of steps to reproduce the issue.</li>
				<li>Your report should be written in coherent English.</li>
				<li>Avoid making duplicate issues. Check to make sure the issue you want to report hasn't been reported already.</li>
				<li>Avoid putting multiple, unrelated issues in one report. Make a separate report for each to help keep things organized.</li>
				<li>I will also accept non-issues such as feature requests or questions as long as they are directly related to the project.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Pull Requests</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Keep your pull requests lightweight and directed towards a single change. If you want to change or add multiple unrelated things, make separate pull requests for each of them.</li>
				<li>Any large changes you plan on making should be discussed with me ahead of time, to make sure it's something I'll accept and also not something I'm already working on.</li>
				<li>Use conventional programming methods. Try to avoid doing unusual things that might leave me or others confused, and add comments next to or above any code that might be confusing.</li>
				<li>Try to keep your formatting consistent with what's already written. I won't deny a PR for this alone unless it's extremely messy, but I still prefer to keep things consistent for the sake of readability.</li>
				<li>Optimize your code as much as possible, but prioritize readability over micro-optimizations.</li>
				<li>Make sure everything works properly before submitting the PR. I will test it myself before accepting, but having it work the first time makes it easier for both of us.</li>
			</ul>
