		<p>If you want to contribute to one of my repositories by making an issue or pull request, please read through the following.</p>
		<h2>Issues</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Issues can be in any format you'd like as long as they are readable and in English.</li>
			<li>Avoid making duplicate issues. Check to make sure the issue you want to report hasn't been reported already.</li>
			<li>Verify that something in the repository you are creating the issue in is directly responsible for your issue, and provide proof of this if possible.</li>
			<li>Also verify that you have correctly installed and/or configured the item that is causing the issue.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h2>Pull Requests</h2>
		<p>The following is a list of things I recommend you do when creating a pull request. You don't have to follow all of them. In the end all I care about is code that is easily readable and fits well with the rest of the code.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Try to keep your pull requests lightweight and directed towards a single change. If you want to change or add multiple unrelated things, make separate pull requests for each of them.</li>
			<li>Complete rewrites and extremely small changes probably won't be accepted unless you can provide proof that the change greatly improves performance and/or functionality.</li>
			<li>Place comments next to or above code that I or other contributors may find confusing.</li>
			<li>Use size 4 tabs instead of spaces.</li>
			<li>Place global variables, includes, usings, and similar things at the very top of the file whenever possible.</li>
			<li>Insert spaces after commas in function arguments, as well as in between parenthesis ( ) and angle brackets { }. Leave square brackets [ ] and arrows < > without spaces.</li>
			<li>Leave whitespace in between functions.</li>
		</ul>
