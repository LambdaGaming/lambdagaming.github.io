						<li>Admin abuse of any kind will result in a warning. If you continue to abuse you will most likely recieve a temporary demote. Ask the owner if you are unsure if something is considered abusive or not.</li>
						<br>
						<li>When teleporting to a player, be sure to ask the player you are teleporting to if you are permitted to do so. The same thing applies when you are teleporting a player to yourself or somebody else.</li>
						<br>
						<li>When noclipping, be sure to announce in chat that you are doing so, and explain why you are doing it. Failure to announce and explain will result in other admins assuming you are abusing and will most likely lead to punishment.</li>
						<br>
						<li>If you are resetting your health, be sure to announce in chat the reason why you are doing so.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Don't use the ulx "fun" commands unless you have permission from the owner to do so.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Always follow the community punishment system that can be found in the main website FAQ page.</li>
