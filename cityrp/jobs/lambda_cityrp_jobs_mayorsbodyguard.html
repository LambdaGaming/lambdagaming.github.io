		<ul>
			<li>Bodyguards can also help out with law enforcement related things such as a drug bust or a firefight, but you must get permission from the mayor before doing so.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Setting up a safe house for the mayor is highly recommended.</li>
			<br>
			<li>If there are multiple agents on duty, one should carpool with the mayor, while another drives an undercover vehicle in front of the limo to ensure protection.</li>
			<br>
			<li>During court sessions, the mayor is usually the judge. As the mayor's bodyguard, it is recommended that you stand guard inside the courtroom near the mayor for security.</li>
			<br>
			<li>You may have higher authority than the Police Chief, but this does not mean you can command him or any other law enforcement officials.</li>
			<br>
			<li>You can deny orders from the chief, but not the mayor. Denying orders from the mayor will result in you possibly getting fired. If the mayor tells you to do something that may be illegal or against server rules, talk it over with him or an admin to get it sorted out.</li>
