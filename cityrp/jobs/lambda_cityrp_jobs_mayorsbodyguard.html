					<h1>CityRP Job: Mayor's Bodyguard</h1>
					<div class="list">
						<h2 style="color:#FF5900">In-Game Description:</h2>
						<p>As the mayor's bodyguard your highest priority will always be the mayor. If he asks for your help, you are required to help. You are equipped with an assault rifle and a sidearm to always ensure that the mayor has the best protection.</p>
						<br>
						<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Duties:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Protect the mayor at all times.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Follow any orders you may receive from the mayor.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Special Job-Specific Items:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Has access to an AR-15 assault rifle by default.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Has access to a FiveSeven pistol by default.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Has access to grenades, assault rifles, shotguns, and sidearms if the weapon perks are activated by the mayor.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Has access to unmarked government vehicles.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Has ability to weapon check players.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Has ability to handcuff and arrest players.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Job-Specific Rules/Tips:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Bodyguards can also help out with law enforcement related things such as a drug bust or a firefight, but you must get permission from the mayor before doing so.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Setting up a safe house for the mayor is highly recommended.</li>
							<br>
							<li>During court sessions, the mayor is usually the judge. As the mayor's bodyguard, it is recommended that you stand guard inside the courtroom near the mayor for security.</li>
							<br>
							<li>You may have higher authority than the Police Chief, but this does not mean you can command him or any other law enforcement officials.</li>
							<br>
							<li>You can deny orders from the chief, but not the mayor. Denying orders from the mayor will result in you possibly getting fired. If the mayor tells you to do something that may be illegal or against server rules, talk it over with him or an admin to get it sorted out.</li>
