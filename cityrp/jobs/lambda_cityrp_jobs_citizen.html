					<h1>CityRP Job: Citizen</h1>
					<div class="list">
						<h2 style="color:#FF5900">In-Game Description:</h2>
						<p>The Citizen is the most basic level of society you can hold. You have no specific role in city life, but there are plenty of things to still do.</p>
						<br>
						<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Duties:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Citizens have no set duties since they are not as limited as other jobs, but to give players an idea of what civilians can do, here is a list: Mining ores for cash, mining iron for crafting, farming for cash, farming for health, money printing, making drugs for personal use, making drugs for cash, running a business such as a gun store, logging for cash, logging for crafting, robbing ATMs, robbing the police bank, robbing the government bank, mugging players for cash, fishing, kidnapping someone and demanding cash for their release, and delivering packages through the courier system.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Job-Specific Rules/Tips:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Citizen is the only "job" that can run stores, other than the cook, but cooks can only sell food. Civilians, on the other hand, can sell anything they please for any price they please, except for food (obviously). Having some kind of security is recommended if you run a store, though, since robbers can come in and steal any of your store items, including money.</li>
							<br>
							<li>If you are planning to rob a store, you can demand up to $500, or any item that the store sells that is worth or adds up to $500.</li>
						</ul>
