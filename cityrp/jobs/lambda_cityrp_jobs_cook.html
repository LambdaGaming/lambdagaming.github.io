			<br>
			<li>If you would like to hand menus out to your customers, there is an item in the F4 menu called "Small Sign". Spawning this will give you a clipboard and pressing your use key on it will allow you to edit, save, and dupe it.</li>
			<br>

			<br>
			<li>You cannot deny service to anyone unless a player has done something to negatively affect you or your business.</li>
			<br>
			<li>It is recommended that you have a microwave set outside when your restaurant is closed.</li>
			<br>
			<li>When fishing, keep in mind that you cannot sell your fish to the NPC. Instead, you must cook the fish and sell it to other players.</li>
