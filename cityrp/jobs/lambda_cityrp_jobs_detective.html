					<h1>CityRP Job: Detective</h1>
					<div class="list">
						<h2>In-Game Description:</h2>
						<p>As a detective, you have two ways to do your job. One way is to work with Law Enforcement to solve crimes and bring people to justice. The other way is to be hired by someone outside of Law Enforcement to privately investigate a crime that the police have ignored.</p>
						<br>
						<h2>Duties:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Be hired by a government official or civilian to help with a case.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<h2>Special Job-Specific Items:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Has access to a free sidearm for protection while on a case.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Has ability to handcuff and weapon check players, investigate evidence left by killed players, and follow trails of killers for a small distance to help collect evidence.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<h2>Job-Specific Rules/Tips:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Unlike a normal government official, a detective does not have to report crimes. Much like a lawyer, anything that your clients say to you, stays between you and that client.</li>
							<br>
							<li>You may charge any amount for your services as long as you tell your client the price before you are hired.</li>
							<br>
							<li>You must do what you're paid to do. Lying about info just to get money or for any other reason is not allowed.</li>
						</ul>
