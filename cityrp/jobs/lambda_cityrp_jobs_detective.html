					<h1>CityRP Job: Detective</h1>
					<div class="list">
						<h2 style="color:#FF5900">In-Game Description:</h2>
						<p>As a detective, you have two ways to do your job. One way is to work with Law Enforcement to solve crimes and bring people to justice. The other way is to be hired by someone outside of Law Enforcement to investigate a private crime that the police don't know about or have forgot about.</p>
						<br>
						<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Duties:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Be hired by a government official or civilian to help with a case.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Special Job-Specific Items:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Has access to a free sidearm for protection while on a case.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Has ability to handcuff and weapon check players if needed.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Has ability to investigate evidence left by killed players.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Job-Specific Rules/Tips:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>A detective's duty, if hired by a government official, is to solve crimes by looking deep into evidence.</li>
							<br>
							<li>A detectives duty, if hired by a civilian, is to cover up a crime that a person may have committed, or privately investigate a crime that the police may ignore.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Unlike a normal government official, a detective does not have to report crimes. Much like a lawyer, anything that your clients say to you, stays between you and that client.</li>
							<br>
							<li>You may charge any amount for your services as long as you tell your client the price before you are hired.</li>
							<br>
							<li>A note to law enforcement: You cannot threaten a detective to give information about other clients. He has a right to keep other people's information secret. (Unless changed by the mayor.)</li>
							<br>
							<li>You must do what you're paid to do. Lying about info just to get money or for any other reason is not allowed.</li>
