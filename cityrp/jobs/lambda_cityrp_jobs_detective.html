		<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Job-Specific Rules/Tips:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>A detective's duty, if hired by a government official, is to solve crimes by looking deep into evidence.</li>
			<br>
			<li>A detectives duty, if hired by a civilian, is to cover up a crime that a person may have committed, or privately investigate a crime that the police may ignore.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Unlike a normal government official, a detective does not have to report crimes. Much like a lawyer, anything that your clients say to you, stays between you and that client.</li>
			<br>
			<li>You may charge any amount for your services as long as you tell your client the price before you are hired.</li>
			<br>
			<li>A note to law enforcement: You cannot threaten a detective to give information about other clients. He has a right to keep other people's information secret. (Unless changed by the mayor.)</li>
			<br>
			<li>You must do what you're paid to do. Lying about info just to get money or for any other reason is not allowed and is considered Fail RP.</li>
