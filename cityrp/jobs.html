				<div id="mayor" class="list">
					<h2 style="text-align:center">Mayor</h2>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>The Mayor is in charge of the whole city. He gets to decide on economic and legal issues, as well as pretty much anything else related to the city and its citizens.</p>
					<h3>Duties</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Set taxes, laws, and perks for your city.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Act as a judge in a court session, or appoint someone else if you are involved in the case.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Give orders to police and firefighters.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Occasionally host events such as a building contest, parade, or lottery to improve relations with your citizens.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Abilities & Items</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Lockdown Command</b> - In an emergency, you may want to call a lockdown to warn citizens to stay indoors. You can do this by typing /lockdown in chat. To remove the lockdown, type /unlockdown.</li>
						<br>
						<li><b>Lottery</b> - You can hold a lottery that anyone can enter by typing /lottery [amount] in chat, with [amount] being the price of the lottery ticket. 75% of all money collected for the lottery will go to the winner, while 25% will go to the bank. The winner is selected and rewarded automatically after a set period of time.</li>
						<br>
						<li><b>Mayor Menu</b> - Used to set taxes, assign perks, and fire players who are under your command. Accessed by pressing F2 while not looking at a door.</li>
						<br>
						<li><b>Parade Command</b> - Lets the city know that a parade is starting by displaying a HUD message and playing music. To start a parade, type /parade in chat. To end a parade, type /endparade.</li>
						<br>
						<li><b>Police Agenda</b> - All police officers have an agenda that is displayed on the top left corner of their screen. You can enter text such as specific orders into the agenda by typing /agenda [text] in chat.</li>
						<br>
						<li><b>Police Secretary</b> - Government and police jobs have access to this NPC for spawning specialized vehicles.</li>
						<br>
						<li><b>Purge Command</b> - If you're unfamiliar with the movie, a purge is a government-sanctioned event where people are allowed to commit any crime they want, and the same is true here. To start a purge, type /purge in chat. To end the purge, type /endpurge. Please note that it's <i>highly</i> recommended that you get admin approval before doing this, just to prevent people from leaving the server prematurely.</li>
						<br>
						<li><b>Radio</b> - Allows you to broadcast your voice to all police officers and firefighters regardless of where they are on the map. You can toggle it by pressing walk + use key, or just walk if you are in a vehicle.</li>
						<br>
						<li><b>Ammo Locker Benefits</b> - Government and police jobs can purchase shotgun and taser ammo from ammo lockers. Money for all ammo purchases comes out of the city bank.</li>
						<br>
						<li><b>Special Playermodel</b> - Having a very high economic rating will grant you access to a special mayor playermodel that you can keep as long as the economy stays great.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Tips</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>As head of the city, you will always have a target on your back. Depending on the amount of haters you have, you should consider arming yourself and having police protection when you are out of the office. Setting up a safe house that you can retreat to in an emergency is also recommended.</li>
						<br>
						<li>While it's not against the rules to be corrupt, your actions may still have consequences. Citizens have the ability to vote you out of office, but that's far from the worst they can do.</li>
						<br>
						<li>When you come up with new laws, you should post them somewhere they can be easily accessed, such as inside city hall. You can do this either by typing /advert [text] in chat to generate a billboard, or by using the 3D2D textscreen tool.</li>
					</ul>
