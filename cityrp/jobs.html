					<h1 style="text-align:center">Mayor</h1>
					<h2>In-Game Description:</h2>
					<p>The Mayor is in charge of the whole city. He gets to decide on economic and legal issues, as well as pretty much anything else related to the city and its citizens.</p>
					<br>
					<h2>Duties:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Set taxes and laws for your city.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Act as a judge in a court session, or make a law enforcement official judge if you are one of the defendants.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Complete events to improve the city's economy.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Control government jobs such as the police force and emergency response.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Occasionally host events such as a building contest or a lottery to improve relations with your citizens.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h2>Special Job-Specific Items:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Has ability to set taxes and laws that players have to play by, control government jobs, control the citys economy, buy perks to improve law enforcement, and fire government and law enforcement officials through the F6 menu.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h2>Job-Specific Rules/Tips:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>If a riot does take place, it is recommended that you place the city into a lockdown. Once the lockdown has started, any civilian who isn't going back to their home should be arrested by patrolling law enforcement. To start a lockdown, type "/lockdown" in chat. To end a lockdown, type "/unlockdown".</li>
						<br>
						<li>As Mayor, you have say on what laws the city has to follow, but if you choose certain laws that a lot of people don't like, they may protest or riot.</li>
						<br>
						<li>As Mayor, you can only use weapons in self defense and not to enforce laws.</li>
						<br>
						<li>It is recommended that you don't make unlawful decisions. A corrupt mayor could mean a dead mayor, and if you break your own laws, the IA Agent has the right to fire you and anyone who is working for you if they have the evidence to do so.</li>
						<br>
						<li>It is recommended that you don't make unfair laws. This could lead to a bad economy and angry citizens. When you are elected, it is recommended that you call all government officials and citizens to the city hall for a meeting on laws.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Setting taxes is probably the most important thing you will do as mayor. To set taxes for certain kinds of jobs, press F2. You can then purchase perks that will improve the economy and set taxes to improve funding for the perks.</li>
						<br>
						<li>There will always be someone in the city who hates your guts to no end, so security is a top priority. It is recommended that you travel in your limo and be accompanied by bodyguards to ensure 24/7 protection.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div id="mayorsbodyguard" style="display:none" class="list">

					</ul>
					<br>
					<h2>Job-Specific Rules/Tips:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Bodyguards can also help out with law enforcement related things such as a drug bust or a firefight, but you must get permission from the mayor before doing so.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Setting up a safe house for the mayor is highly recommended.</li>
						<br>
						<li>During court sessions, the mayor is usually the judge. As the mayor's bodyguard, it is recommended that you stand guard inside the courtroom near the mayor for security.</li>
						<br>
						<li>You may have higher authority than the Police Chief, but this does not mean you can command him or any other law enforcement officials.</li>
						<br>
						<li>You can deny orders from the chief, but not the mayor. Denying orders from the mayor will result in you possibly getting fired. If the mayor tells you to do something that may be illegal or against server rules, talk it over with him or an admin to get it sorted out.</li>
