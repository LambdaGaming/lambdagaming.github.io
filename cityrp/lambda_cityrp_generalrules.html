					<div class="list">
						<ol>
							<li>Along with these rules, be sure to read the community-wide rules which can be found by clicking <a href="https://lambdagaming.github.io/lambda_communityrules_mainrules.html">here</a>.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Don't mass RDM. (Killing multiple people without reason.) You may, however, randomly kill players if they have done something negative to you. For example, if someone kills your friend and you see him, you may kill him without punishment
								if he hasn't died since the incident. Keep in mind that law enforcement can still intervene and arrest you for murder. You may also kill players if they enter a KOS (kill on sight) zone that you have set up, however depending on the law, you could be arrested for having a KOS zone. Using car bombs or other weapons that indirectly kill the player also apply to this rule.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Don't break the Fair Game Rule. This means players cannot kill their killer for revenge, and players cannot return to a raid or other similar RP event unless they have a member of their squad or gang still participating in the event.</li>
							<br>
							<li>If you are being held at gun point and are unarmed, you have to do what the gunman says. You may attempt to trick the gunman and run away, but doing this may result in the gunman shooting
								you, which will then be considered a valid kill. You may also attempt to kill the gunman if you have a weapon in your weapon slot. You cannot run away, however, if you have been killed by the gunman, revived by a medic, and are still being held at gunpoint after you are revived.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Using job-specific items to commit crimes is allowed, but if government officials or law enforcement officials find out about it, you may be fined or forced back to the default civilian job.</li>
							<br>
							<li>All citizen jobs except banker and detective can commit any crimes a normal civilian can, but they also must maintain their assigned job.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Once a new mayor is elected, he/she is granted a 10 minute "cooldown" time to get laws and taxes configured. This means that players cannot protest or threaten the mayor until the 10 minutes after the elections is over. If a player wants to rebel or protest against the mayor, they must sign a petition and give it to the mayor to let him know of the changes they want made. If the mayor ignores these requests, only then can players riot/rebel/violent protest. If players successfully raid the mayor's office, they cannot kill the mayor unless he attempts to fight back, otherwise they must kidnap him. After a petition is signed and given to the mayor, another one cannot be signed for 30 minutes, and petitions must reference valid laws.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Don't use a job just to use it's abilities, meaning don't be a Tow Truck Driver just to repair your own car, or be a Paramedic just to heal yourself for free. If you wish to do this, you must stay as that job for a while and serve other players.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Equipping weapons from your inventory after being weapon checked is not allowed, unless you are no longer in sight of the players who weapon checked you. This rule applies to both the automatic large metal detector and the manual handheld one.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Prop surfing is not allowed no matter what, and prop climbing is only allowed as long as it properly fits in with the RP. For example, prop climbing to get over a fading door and break into someone's home is allowed, but prop climbing into the air to escape the police is not allowed.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Players are permitted to respawn their vehicle if it falls into a spot where tow trucks cannot get to, such as a steep ravine or a lake. Players can also respawn their vehicle if it is at 0% health and there isn't an active tow truck driver to fix it.</li>
							<br>
							<li>If you steal an item you must somehow announce to the owner that the item was stolen. Failure to do so may result in the owner respawning that stolen item.</li>
							<br>
							<li>If you kidnap someone, you must have a valid reason for doing so. For example, randomly handcuffing someone and walking away would be invalid, but capturing someone and demanding payment for their release would be valid. Failure to give a proper reason could result in the person you kidnapped being released by an admin.</li>
							<br>
							<li>The maximum jail time allowed for a single sentence is 20 minutes if the arresting officer manually takes the player to the jails, and 10 minutes if the arresting officer uses the arrest stick.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Players cannot obstruct public entities. Example: Camping at a hospital to keep other people from healing and blocking the mayor vote NPC are not allowed. See the server item page for a full list of public entities. Iron refiners and purifiers are exceptions to this rule.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Players cannot suicide unless they have been roleplaying as a suicidal character prior to being wanted or arrested by the police.</li>
							<br>
							<li>If a player becomes a barricaded suspect (armed inside of a building and refusing to cooperate with police), or if a player is in a pursuit, the police are allowed to keep them wanted until they are arrested or killed. Police can also rewant players to extend the time if they committed a new crime that isn't stated in the previous wanted reason. If the highest ranking government official currently on the server allows it, police may post a bounty for a wanted player that a hitman can pursue after the 10 minute wanted period is over.</li>
							<br>
							<li>OOC chats that appear to be adverts can be used in RP situations. This includes the name of the person who sent it, and the contents of the message itself. (Valid Example: "(OOC) John Miller: selling stolen car at cabins pm for price" This chat would be able to be used by police to conduct an investigation and potentially arrest John.)</li>
							<br>
							<li>Players can only become a terrorist once per session. (Different from a rebel or raider, terrorist refers to players setting their job to Terrorist to kill anyone they see.)</li>
							<br>
							<li>When mugging a person, you can only demand up to $200, unless you manage to kidnap the person, then you can demand up to $3000 for their release.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Players are allowed to build their own custom vehicles as long as they are breakable or the driver has the ability to be damaged.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Cops are allowed to go rogue if they agree to the following conditions: (1) the rogue player must provide a valid reason (EX: being fired by the mayor is not valid) as to why he/she is doing so, and (2) the player must change their job if they die while rogue.</li>
