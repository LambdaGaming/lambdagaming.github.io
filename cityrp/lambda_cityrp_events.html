					<h1>CityRP Roleplay Events</h1>
					<p>This is a list of RP events that players may encounter while on the server. This includes events from the old page, as well as the newly added automated events.</p>
					<br>
					<div class="list">
						<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Lockdown:</h2>
						<p><u>Description:</u> A lockdown is called by the mayor when there is an active threat in the city and citizens need to stay inside. Once started, a city announcement will play and a message will display above chat notifying players of the event. Police are typically ordered to find the suspect who caused the lockdown while the mayor remains locked in his office. This event automatically ends if the mayor dies.</p>
						<p><u>Command:</u> /lockdown to start, /unlockdown to end</p>
						<br>
						<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Parade:</h2>
						<p><u>Description:</u> A parade is usually called by the mayor to celebrate some major event, such as winning the election or finally capturing a wanted criminal. Once started, music will start playing and a message will display above chat notifying players of the event. This event automatically ends if the mayor dies.</p>
						<p><u>Command:</u> /parade to start, /endparade to end</p>
						<br>
						<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Purge:</h2>
						<p><u>Description:</u> A purge is called when the mayor feels he cannot control the city anymore and wants to let the server turn to anarchy. Once started, the EAS purge message will play and a message will display above chat notifying players of the event. This event automatically ends if the mayor dies.</p>
						<p><u>Command:</u> /purge to start, /endpurge to end</p>
						<br>
						<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Random Fires:</h2>
						<p><u>Description:</u> Random fires spawn randomly around the map at suburban and commercial buildings. The fires are set to grow until the entire building is engulfed. The fires do not go out on their own, only emergency responders can put them out. If the fire is too large to handle, a superadmin can force the fires out. Currently, putting out fires does not earn emergency responders a reward.</p>
						<p><u>Target Jobs:</u> Emergency Response Commander, Emergency Responder</p>
						<br>
						<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Overturned Truck:</h2>
						<p><u>Description:</u> The overturned truck event spawns a truck and a trailer laying on it's side across a random road  on the map. The truck spawns with a random chance to catch fire. Once the truck is back on it's wheels, the event will end and any police and tow truck drivers in the area will be rewarded.</p>

						<br>
						<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Catering Service:</h2>
						<p><u>Description:</u> The catering service event spawns an NPC at a random location outside of a commercial or residential building. The NPC will message the cook stating what type of pizza they want. Once the cook delivers the correct type of pizza to the NPC, he will be rewarded.</p>
						<p><u>Target Jobs:</u> Cook</p>
						<br>
						<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Bank Escort:</h2>
						<p><u>Description:</u> The bank escort event requires the banker to get a police escort to the banker NPC, where he will then deposit a check from the check machine. Unlike normally cashing in a check, however, during the event, the banker NPC will keep the money instead of giving it to the banker.</p>

						<br>
						<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Shooter:</h2>
