		<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Purge:</h2>

		<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Random Fires:</h2>
		<p>Description: Random fires spawn randomly around the map at suburban and commercial buildings. The fires are set to grow until the entire building is engulfed. The fires do not go out on their own, only emergency responders can put them out. If the fire is too large to handle, a superadmin can force the fires out. Currently, putting out fires does not earn emergency responders a reward.</p>
		<p>Target Jobs: Emergency Response Commander, Emergency Responder.</p>
		<br>
		<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Overturned Truck:</h2>
		<p>Description: The overturned truck event spawns a truck and a trailer laying on it's side across a random road  on the map. The truck spawns with a random chance to catch fire. Once the truck is back on it's wheels, the event will end and any police and tow truck drivers in the area will be rewarded.</p>
