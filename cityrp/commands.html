		<div class="main">
			<p>The following is a list of non-DarkRP chat commands that players can use on CityRP. If you are viewing this from in-game, a list of chat commands for the DarkRP gamemode specifically can be found on the left.</p>
			<div class="list">
				<hr>
				<h2>URL Commands</h2>
				<p>These commands will open URLs for various community and server-related sites. You will be prompted before the URLs open in your Steam overlay.</p>
				<h3>!addons</h3>
				<p>Opens the page to the server addon collection.</p>
				<h3>!group</h3>
				<p>Opens the page to the Lambda Gaming Steam group.</p>
				<h3>!rules</h3>
				<p>Opens the CityRP Rules and Guidelines page. This page is also accessible from the F1 menu if you are using the x86-64 beta branch.</p>
				<hr>

				<h2>Gameplay Commands</h2>
				<p>These commands are intended to be used during normal gameplay.</p>
				<h3>!alert</h3>
				<p>Alerts all police and firefighters to your location. Requires that you have life alert, which can be purchased at the NPC shop.</p>
				<h3>!alertcheck</h3>
				<p>Tells you whether or not you have life alert equipped.</p>
				<h3>!undercover</h3>
				<p>Changes your job to Undercover Officer without notifying the rest of the server. It also changes your job name to Citizen to prevent your cover from being blown on the scoreboard.</p>
				<h3>!viewproperties</h3>
				<p>Outlines every ownable property with a wireframe box so you can see where the boundaries are. Type this command again to remove the outlines.</p>
				<h3>!firemayor</h3>
				<p>Casts a vote to fire the mayor. At least 75% of all players on the server must vote for it to pass. Intended to be used if the mayor is doing a terrible job and the citizens want him removed from office peacefully. If a vote successfully passes, the mayor is instantly fired and he cannot enter another election for 30 minutes. A vote will fail after 5 minutes if not enough people vote.</p>
				<hr>

				<h2>Mayor Commands</h2>
				<p>Only the mayor can use these commands.</p>
				<h3>!fixeco</h3>
				<p>Adds 30 eco points at the cost of $300 from the mayor funds. Will not work if there is less than $300 in the mayor funds.</p>
