		<div class="main">
			<p style="text-align:center">The following is a list of non-DarkRP chat commands that players can use on CityRP. If you are viewing this from in-game, a list of chat commands for the DarkRP gamemode specifically can be found on the left.</p>
			<h2>Gameplay Commands</h2>
			<hr>
			<h3>!alert</h3>
			<p>Alerts all police and firefighters to your location. Requires that you have life alert, which can be purchased at the NPC shop.</p>
			<h3>!alertcheck</h3>
			<p>Tells you whether or not you have life alert equipped.</p>
			<h3>!viewproperties</h3>
			<p>Outlines every ownable property with a wireframe box so you can see where the boundaries are. Type this command again to remove the outlines.</p>
			<h3>!firemayor</h3>
			<p>Casts a vote to fire the mayor. At least 75% of all players on the server must vote for it to pass. Intended to be used if the mayor is doing a terrible job and the citizens want him removed from office peacefully. If a vote successfully passes, the mayor is instantly fired and he cannot enter another election for 30 minutes. A vote will fail after 5 minutes if not enough people vote.</p>
			<h2>URL Commands</h2>
