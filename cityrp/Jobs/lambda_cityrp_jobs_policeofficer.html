            <ul>
                <li>A Police Officer's main duty is to follow orders from the police chief. If there is no police chief available, command will either go to SWAT or the mayor, depending on which is available first. If neither of those jobs are available to command, each individual officer will have to take all matters into their own hands.</li>
                <br>
                <li>As a police officer, you are permitted to set up checkpoints, as long as you get permission from either the mayor or the police chief. If those jobs aren't available for you to ask, you may do it without permission.</li>
                <br>
                <li>When setting up a checkpoint, it is recommended you do the following things: 1.)Have the checkpoint on a busy road/intersection to get as many people checked as possible, 2.)Block the road with fading door barriers so nobody can pass without being checked, and 3.) Have players with cars stop at the checkpoint and get out of their vehicle so they can be weapon checked, and players on foot be stopped by another officer to be weapon checked.</li>
