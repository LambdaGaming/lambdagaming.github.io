            <p>As a banker, your job is to hand out loans and store money in deposit boxes to collect interest from other players. Loans must come from your personal wallet, so make sure you have a good amount of money saved up. If there is an emergency event (such as a hostage situation) that requires a few thousand dollars, you are permitted to extract money from the check machine in the back of the bank and cash the check in at the banker NPC. You are by default permitted to carry weapons around the bank and banker NPC for protection. If you see any illegal activity going on inside the bank, you are to report it to police.</p>
