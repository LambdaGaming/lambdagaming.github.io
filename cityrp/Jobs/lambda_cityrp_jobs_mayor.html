            <h2 style="color:#FF5900">Job-Specific Rules/Tips:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>If a riot does take place, it is recommended that you place the city into a lockdown. Once the lockdown has started, any civilian who isn't going back to their home should be arrested by patrolling law enforcement. To start a lockdown, type "/lockdown" in chat. To end a lockdown, type "/unlockdown".</li>
                <br>
                <li>As Mayor, you have say on what laws the city has to follow, but if you choose certain laws that a lot of people don't like, they may protest or riot.</li>
                <br>
                <li>As Mayor, you can only use weapons in self defense and not to enforce laws.</li>
                <br>
                <li>It is recommended that you don't make unlawful decisions. A corrupt mayor could mean a dead mayor, and if you break your own laws, the IA Agent has the right to fire you and anyone who is working for you if they have the evidence to do so.</li>
                <br>
                <li>It is recommended that you don't make unfair laws. This could lead to a bad economy and angry citizens. When you are elected, it is recommended that you call all government officials and citizens to the city hall for a meeting on laws.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Setting taxes is probably the most important thing you will do as mayor. To set taxes for certain kinds of jobs, press F2. You can then purchase perks that will improve the economy and set taxes to improve funding for the perks.</li>
                <br>
                <li>There will always be someone in the city who hates your guts to no end, so security is a top priority. It is recommended that you travel in your limo and be accompanied by federal agents to ensure 24/7 protection.</li>
