            <p>As a hitman, you earn money by taking hits from other players. To request a hit to a hitman, type !placehit in chat. You can then enter the player you want dead and the price you are paying to the hitman. If the hitman has a hit that he is currently on the job for, other hits cannot be placed. You can also earn extra money as a hitman by acting as a bounty hunter for government officials and getting paid to capture wanted players. Please note that as a hitman, you must supply your own weapons.</p>
