            <ul>
                <li>Much like the police officer, you also get your orders from the police chief, so if you need something to do, ask the chief.</li>
                <br>
                <li>You are permitted to pull over anyone if you have a reason to, but that isn't your top priority. Your top priority is to make arrests while concealing your identity as a cop.</li>
