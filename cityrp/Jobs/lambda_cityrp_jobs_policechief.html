			<br>
			<li>The police chief's main duty is to order other officers to do certain things. If you have nothing for them to do, just tell them to patrol the streets and look out for illegal activity.</li>
			<br>
			<li>You on the other hand get your orders from the mayor, who will usually tell you to enforce the new laws he has put down. Much like the bodyguards, you cannot deny orders from the mayor, but if you think an order is unlawful, talk it over with him.</li>
