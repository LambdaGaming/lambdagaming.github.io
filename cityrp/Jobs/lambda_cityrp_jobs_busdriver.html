            <p>The bus driver's duty is just as the name suggests: to drive buses. To spawn your bus, go to the car dealer where you would spawn a normal civilian car. You may create a set of rules that your passengers must follow such as setting bus stop locations or having your passengers remain quiet while on the bus. If a passenger doesn't follow these rules, you have a right to deny them service and kick them off of your bus.</p>
