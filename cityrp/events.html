					<h1>CityRP Roleplay Events</h1>
					<p>This is a list of RP events that players may encounter while on the server. This includes events from the old page, as well as the newly added automated events.</p>
					<br>
					<div class="list">
						<hr>
						<h2>Lockdown:</h2>
						<p><u>Description:</u> Called by the mayor when there is an active threat in the city and citizens need to stay inside. Once started, a city announcement will play and a message will display above chat notifying players of the event. Police are typically ordered to find the suspect who caused the lockdown while the mayor remains locked in his office. This event automatically ends if the mayor dies or disconnects.</p>
						<p><u>Command:</u> /lockdown to start, /unlockdown to end</p>
						<hr>

						<h2>Parade:</h2>
						<p><u>Description:</u> Usually called by the mayor to celebrate some major event, such as winning the election or capturing a wanted criminal. Once started, music will start playing and a message will display above chat notifying players of the event. This event automatically ends if the mayor dies or disconnects.</p>
						<p><u>Command:</u> /parade to start, /endparade to end</p>
						<hr>

						<h2>Purge:</h2>
						<p><u>Description:</u> Called when the mayor feels he cannot control the city anymore and wants to let the server turn to anarchy. Once started, the EAS purge message will play and a message will display above chat notifying players of the event. This event automatically ends if the mayor dies or disconnects.</p>
						<p><u>Command:</u> /purge to start, /endpurge to end</p>
						<hr>

						<h2>Random Fires:</h2>
						<p><u>Description:</u> Spawns randomly at suburban and commercial buildings. The fires are set to grow until the entire building is engulfed. The fires do not go out on their own. If the fire is too large to handle, emergency responders can request a superadmin to have the fires turned off.</p>

						<hr>

						<h2>Overturned Truck:</h2>
						<p><u>Description:</u> Spawns a truck and a trailer laying on it's side across a random road  on the map. The truck spawns with a random chance to catch fire. Once the truck is back on it's wheels, the event will end and any police and mechanics in the area will be rewarded.</p>

						<h2>Bank Escort:</h2>

						<hr>

						<h2>Bank Robbery:</h2>
						<p><u>Description:</u> Spawns 2-6 hostile citizen NPCs armed with either a pistol, SMG, or shotgun inside the bank. Killing each NPC will reward $200 and a crafting blueprint. The event won't end until all NPCs have been killed.</p>
