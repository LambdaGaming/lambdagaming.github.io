				<ol>
					<li>Along with these rules, be sure to read the community-wide rules which can be found by clicking <a href="https://lambdagaming.github.io/community_rules.html">here</a>.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Don't randomly kill people without a valid reason. Valid reasons include (but are not limited to) someone doing something negative to you in the same life, and someone entering your KOS zone. Using car bombs or other objects that indirectly kill players also apply to this rule.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Don't kill players just because they killed you, and don't keep an event going after you died unless members of your team are still taking part in the event. This is to prevent endless battles from happening.</li>
					<br>
					<li>If you are held at gunpoint, you can do whatever is necessary to survive as long as it doesn't break any other rules. However, if you are killed by the gunman, revived by a medic, and are still being held at gunpoint you have to comply with the gunman to avoid a potential infinite loop of dying.</li>
					<br>
					<li>You can commit crimes as any job, but you still have to perform your assigned duties.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Newly elected mayors are granted a 10 minute cooldown to get things setup. Protesting/raiding/threatening/killing the mayor during this time is not allowed.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Equipping weapons from your inventory after being searched with the handheld metal detector is not allowed unless you are no longer in sight of the people who checked you.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Prop surfing is not allowed no matter what, and prop climbing is only allowed as long as it realistically fits in with the RP. Example: Prop climbing to get over a fence and break into someone's home is allowed, but prop climbing into the air to escape the police is not allowed.</li>
					<br>
					<li>You cannot respawn your vehicle if there is an active mechanic on the server unless the vehicle has fallen into a spot the tow truck cannot get to or the vehicle is permanently undrivable.</li>
					<br>
					<li>If you steal a car you must somehow announce to the owner that it was stolen. If you fail to do so and the owner respawns it, they will not be at fault.</li>
					<br>
					<li>If you restrain someone or lock them in a room, you must do something with them such as demand money for their release or force them to give up valuable information.</li>
					<br>
					<li>The maximum jail time allowed for a full sentence is 20 minutes. This rule still applies if you manually take the player to jail and don't use the arrest stick.</li>
					<br>
					<li>You cannot obstruct public entities such as the mayor's secretary, drug dealer, iron refiner, and mining factories. See the server item page for a full list of public entities.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Police cannot redo a warrant on someone after the warrant expires unless they have reason to believe the suspect committed a new crime not listed in the previous warrant. This rule does not apply if the suspect is actively fleeing police or if they barricaded themselves while the old warrant was still active. Police are allowed to post bounties for wanted players that hitmen can pursue once the warrant expires.</li>
					<br>
					<li>OOC chats that appear to be adverts can be used in RP situations. This includes the name of the person who sent it, and the contents of the message itself. (Valid Example: "(OOC) John Miller: selling stolen car at cabins pm for price" This chat would be able to be used by police to conduct an investigation and potentially arrest John.)</li>
					<br>
					<li>When mugging a person, you can only demand up to $500 unless you manage to kidnap them, then you can demand up to $5000 for their release.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Cops are allowed to go rogue as long as they agree to change jobs if they die while rogue. (Going rogue means to refuse to follow any orders from the mayor and/or police chief.)</li>
					<br>
					<li>Media such as screenshots or videos of RP events may be used for RP purposes (such as evidence in court) if the media can be proven to be from the current session.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Using meta information obtained outside of the game is allowed, but it is recommended you use the in-game text chat when participating in major RP events to help admins prove innocence and guilt if a rule is broken.</li>
