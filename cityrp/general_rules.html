			<ol>
				<li>Along with these rules, be sure to read the <a href="https://lambdagaming.github.io/community_rules.html">community-wide rules.</a></li>
				<br>
				<li>Don't randomly kill people without a valid reason. Valid reasons include (but are not limited to) someone doing something negative to you in the same life, and someone entering your (appropriately marked) KOS zone. This also applies to cooks who intentionally try to starve people.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Don't kill players just because they killed you, and don't keep an event going after you died unless members of your team are still taking part in the event. This is to prevent endless battles from happening.</li>
				<br>
				<li>You can commit crimes as any job, but you still have to perform your assigned duties.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Newly elected mayors are granted a 20 minute cooldown to get things setup. Protesting/raiding/threatening/killing the mayor during this time is not allowed.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Prop surfing is not allowed. Prop pushing and prop climbing are allowed as long as doing so doesn't cause players or items to be damaged or leave the playable area of the map.</li>
				<br>
				<li>You are only allowed to respawn your personal vehicle under the following conditions: 1) Your car is missing and nobody told you it was stolen or repossessed; 2) Your car needs towed/repaired but the mechanic is either inactive or won't help you; 3) Your car is unfixable and can only be used again if respawned.</li>
				<br>
				<li>If you restrain a person for an extended period of time by kidnapping, arresting, etc, you or someone you are working with needs to interact with them every 10 minutes or less. If you fail to do so, the restrained player can contact an admin to be set free.</li>
				<br>
				<li>You cannot obstruct public entities such as the mayor's secretary, smuggler, car dealer, contraband dealer, and supermarket for an extended period of time.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Police are only allowed to redo a warrant on someone after it expires under the following conditions: 1) There's reasonable evidence that suggests the suspect has committed a new crime not listed in the previous warrant; 2) The police are actively witnessing the suspect continuing to commit the crime as the warrant expires, such as during a pursuit or standoff. If neither of these conditions are met, the police can put out a bounty that hitmen can pursue.</li>
				<br>
				<li>OOC chats that appear to be adverts can be used in RP situations. This includes the name of the person who sent it, and the contents of the message itself. (Valid Example: "(OOC) John Miller: selling stolen car at cabins pm for price" This chat would be able to be used by police to conduct an investigation and potentially arrest John.)</li>
				<br>
				<li>Media such as screenshots or videos of RP events may be used for RP purposes (such as evidence in court) as long as the media can be proven to be from the current session. To prove the media is from the current session, there needs to be identifying features within the media itself, and not its metadata.</li>
