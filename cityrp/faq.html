			<h3>What is this server about?</h3>
			<p style="text-align:left">CityRP is basically a more in-depth version of DarkRP. We have 6 maps that all feature large, open cities with suburban and/or rural outskirts. These maps get cycled through every session unless someone requests to play on a specific one. Due to the scale of the maps, players are able to purchase a variety of vehicles including off-road vehicles, utility vehicles, sports cars, and a few meme vehicles. There are a wide variety of weapons and items that players can buy, sell, and use. Some items can be stored in players inventories so they can be easily transported and saved across sessions. Some jobs that players can take on CityRP are banker, cook, detective, hitman, mechanic, bus driver, news cameraman, police chief, police officer, SWAT commander, SWAT officer, undercover officer, emergency responder, mayor, mayors bodyguard, and internal affairs agent.</p>

			<h3>What are the rules for this server?</h3>
			<p style="text-align:left">Rules and guidelines for this server can be found <a href="https://lambdagaming.github.io/cityrp/main.html">here.</a></p>
			<hr>
			<h3>Why aren't there many criminal jobs?</h3>
			<p style="text-align:left">To add an element of surprise to roleplay events, most criminal abilities are included with the basic civilian jobs (Citizen, Mechanic, News Cameraman and Bus Driver). Some illegal things that civilians can do are steal cars, mug players for money or items, kidnap, take hostages, print money, make/grow drugs, and rob banks.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>How do I make money?</h3>
			<p style="text-align:left">There are plenty of ways (both legal and illegal) to make money. Some legal things to make money on are farming, mining, logging, selling crafted items, repairing cars (separate job), cooking (separate job), making a news station (separate job), and being hired as a detective (separate job). <br>
				Some illegal things to make money on are being hired as a hitman (separate job), mugging, money printing, drug making, stealing from ATMs, and bank robbing.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>Do I need to announce my actions such as robbing the bank?</h3>
			<p style="text-align:left">Nope! It is up to civilians to report crime as they see it go down. Some things such as ATMs and cars have alarms that can be heard from a certain distance if they are broken into, and higher-scale crimes such as robbing the bank automatically alert the police.</p>
