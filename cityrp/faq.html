					<h1>CityRP FAQs</h1>

					<h3>What are the rules for this server?</h3>
					<p style="text-align:left">Rules and guidelines for this server can be found <a href="https://lambdagaming.github.io/cityrp/lambda_cityrp_main.html">here.</a></p>
					<hr>
					<h3>Why aren't there many criminal jobs?</h3>
					<p style="text-align:left">To add an element of surprise to roleplay events, most criminal abilities are included with the basic civilian jobs (Citizen, Mechanic, News Cameraman and Bus Driver). Some illegal things that civilians can do are steal cars, mug players for money or items, kidnap, take hostages, print money, make/grow drugs, and rob banks.</p>
					<hr>
					<h3>How do I make money?</h3>
					<p style="text-align:left">There are plenty of ways (both legal and illegal) to make money. Some legal things to make money on are farming, mining, logging, selling crafted items, repairing cars (separate job), cooking (separate job), making a news station (separate job), and being hired as a detective (separate job). <br>
						Some illegal things to make money on are being hired as a hitman (separate job), mugging, money printing, drug making, stealing from ATMs, and bank robbing.</p>
					<hr>
					<h3>Do I need to announce my actions such as robbing the bank?</h3>
					<p style="text-align:left">Nope! It is up to civilians to report crime as they see it go down. Some things such as ATMs have alarms that can be heard from a certain distance, and higher-scale crimes such as robbing the bank have automated systems to alert police that the robbery is taking place.</p>
