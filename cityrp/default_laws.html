		<div class="main">
			<p>Below is a list of default laws the city must go by if there is no mayor to change them. Everything listed has the ability to be changed by the mayor, but the mayor is not restricted to just these laws. Please note that these are in-game roleplay laws. You won't get punished by admins for breaking these, though you may end up in legal trouble in the RP.</p>
