					<h1>Sandbox Basewars Rules</h1>
					<h2>List of Different Modes:</h2>
					<p>Note: Any of these 4 types can be played co-op. Meaning that multiple people can be in a single base. Playing co-op is not recommended if there is an odd number of players on the server.</p>
					<div class="list">
						<ol>
							<li><u>Raid:</u> Raid bases for items that you can use as an advantage for your base, such as turrets and mines. The team last to surrender or have their base taken over due to lack of resources wins. (Recommended for 3 players or less.)</li>
							<br>
							<li><u>Takeover:</u> Completely take over a players base, while still controlling your own. The team who takes over all of the bases first wins. (Recommended for at least 4 players.)</li>
							<br>
							<li><u>Item Quest:</u> Get in a player's base and steal a specific item. Before the event starts, each player must announce what their special item is. First player to have every player's item INSIDE their base for at least 5 minutes wins. (Recommended for 3 players or less.)</li>
							<br>
							<li><u>Destruction:</u> Use your weaponry to attempt to destroy other bases. The owner of the last base standing is the winner. The following weapons are banned from this mode: All pointshop weapons, large Gbombs, and admin-only PewPew weapons. Note that you must build your base out of destructible materials such as wood, glass, or welds that can be broken with enough force. (Recommended for at least 4 players.)</li>
							<br>
							<li><u>Escort:</u> Deliver a high-value weapon to the enemies base without the enemy team destroying it. One team sets up their base while the other team gets their vehicles ready for transport on the other side of the map. If the escorting team can get the weapon safely to the enemies base, they can then detonate it and kill everyone in the base. Anyone left alive the at base after the detonation can continue to fight to the death until one team kills all players on the other team. All weapons are allowed besides large GBombs. (Recommended for at least 2 players.)</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					<br>
					<h2>Rules:</h2>
					<p>Note: Breaking any of these rules could result in a disqualification from the event, and possibly a kick from the server.</p>
					<div class="list">
						<ol>
							<li>If you die, teleporting/noclipping back to your base it not allowed. It is recommended that you build near a spawn point for easy access, or set your own spawn point at your base using the JI Defense Solutions sleeping bag.</li>
							<br>
							<li>If you use fading doors, you must have ONE button or keypad on both sides of the door.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Players must have at least one entrance to your base available to them at all times. How that entrance is built is up to you.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Building up your defenses (such as giving yourself more weapons or spawning more barricades or fading doors) after the event has started is not allowed. Repairing a piece of your base that was built prior to the event starting is allowed, however.</li>
							<br>
							<li>If you die while attempting to raid a base, you cannot return to that base right after you respawn, you must first check into your own base.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Participating in these events is not required. If you choose to not participate, you cannot physically interact with players who are in the event or their items.</li>
