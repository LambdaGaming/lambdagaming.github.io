					<h1>Community-Wide Rules</h1>
					<div class="list">
						<ol>
							<li>The most important rule to follow in this community is to just be respectful to others and don't be annoying. We don't mind if you break a few rules here and there as long as you aren't doing it to purposefully annoy or harass people and you stop when you're told to.</li>
							<br>
							<li>On Gmod servers, don't spawn large dupes or randomly spawn in dupes you don't the size of with the normal dupe tool. Use the advanced dupe tool for that if it's available on the server.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Leaving the server and immediately rejoining to avoid admin punishment or some other type of interaction is not allowed.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Bullying, harassment, and discrimination will not be tolerated. Doing it ironically or as a joke is acceptable as long as the other person knows that.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Do not interact with AFK players, their items, or anything that involves them until they return. This also includes players who aren't on the server at all.</li>
							<br>
							<li>On Gmod servers, you may prop block as long as the area you're blocking off has at least one entrance that can be accessible to all players.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Don't abuse bugs/glitches/exploits/etc. If you find one, report it to an admin or the server owner right away.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Hacking, DDoSing, or otherwise negatively or illegally interfering with a server (including threats) will not be tolerated, and doing so will result in a permanent ban without warning.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Breaking multiple rules on purpose for the sake of getting a reaction out of players or admins will not be tolerated and will result in a permanent ban without warning.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Players are granted a full refund on in-game items if they lose something due to a bug, invalid kill, server crash, client game crash, or other means of dying or disconnecting that were not intentional by the player. (Does not protect against valid admin punishments.)</li>
