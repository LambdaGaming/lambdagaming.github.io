					<h1>Community-Wide Rules</h1>
					<div class="list">
						<ol>
							<li>The most important rule to follow in this community is to just be respectful to others and don't be annoying. We don't mind if you break a few rules here and there as long as you aren't doing it to purposefully annoy or harass people and you stop when you're told to.</li>
							<br>
							<li>On Gmod servers, don't spawn large dupes or randomly spawn in dupes you don't the size of to avoid lagging the server. This does not apply if you're using the advanced dupe tool.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Leaving the server and immediately rejoining to avoid admin punishment or some other type of player interaction is not allowed.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Bullying, harassment, and discrimination will not be tolerated. Doing it ironically or as a joke is acceptable as long as the other person knows that and is okay with it.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Do not interact with AFK players, their items, or anything that involves them until they return. This also includes players who aren't on the server at all.</li>
							<br>
							<li>On Gmod servers, you may prop block as long as the area you're blocking off has at least one accessible entrance. For an entrance to be accessible it must have either a fading door or an open hole that players can walk, jump, crouch, or crawl through. If fading doors are used, they must stay open for at least 1 second.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Don't abuse bugs/glitches/exploits/etc. If you find one, report it to an admin or the server owner right away.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Hacking, DDoSing, or otherwise negatively or illegally interfering with a server (including threats) will not be tolerated, and doing so will result in a permanent ban without warning.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Players are granted a full refund on in-game items that they lost due to a bug, invalid kill, server crash, client game crash, or other means of unintentionally dying or disconnecting. This does not protect against valid kills and admin punishments.</li>
