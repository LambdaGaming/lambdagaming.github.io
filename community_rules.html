					<h1>Community-Wide Rules</h1>
					<p>Note: The following rules only apply to all servers unless otherwise stated after the rule.</p>
					<div class="list">
						<ol>
							<li>Don't spam ANYTHING.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Don't spawn large dupes or randomly spawn in dupes you don't the size of with the normal dupe tool. Use the advanced dupe for that if it's available on the server.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Leaving the server to avoid punishment or to avoid a certain RP event is not allowed.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Bullying and harassment will not be tolerated. (Insulting people a few times is not considered bullying. This rule does not apply to RP servers as long as the bullying or harassment is obviously part of the roleplay and not directed towards a person outside of it.)</li>
							<br>
							<li>Do not interact with AFK players, their items, or anything that involves them until they return. This also includes players who aren't on the server at all.</li>
							<br>
							<li>You may prop block only if you have a keypad and/or fading door for other players to break in. Hiding the keypad so it's harder to get in is allowed. (Only applies to RP servers.)</li>
							<br>
							<li>Don't mess with other players things. Ask permission from the item owner before messing with it. (Unless messing with it is part of a valid RP situation.)</li>
							<br>
							<li>Don't abuse bugs/glitches/exploits/etc. If you find one, report it to a superadmin or the server owner right away.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Hacking of any kind (including threats) will not be tolerated, and doing so will most likely get you banned without a warning.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Trolling will not be tolerated. (Applies to all servers but does not apply to RP servers as long as it is obvious that the trolling is part of the roleplay and not outside of it.)</li>
							<br>
							<li>Using information received outside to influence your actions inside of the RP is not allowed. For example, telling someone over Discord or steam chat that you are being arrested at a certain location, and having that person show up to save you is not allowed. (Only applies to RP servers.)</li>
							<br>
							<li>Media such as screenshots or videos of RP events may be used for RP purposes (such as evidence in court) if the media can be proven to be from the same session it is being used in. (Only applies to RP servers. The only exception to the fact that the media has to be proven to be part of the same session are loans from bankers since they carry through sessions until they are paid off.)</li>
							<br>
							<li>Players are granted a full refund on in-game items and/or money if they lose either of those things due to a bug, invalid kill, server crash, client game crash, or other means of disconnecting from the server that were not intentional by the client. (Does not protect against valid admin kicks and bans.)</li>
