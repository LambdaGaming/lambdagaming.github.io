					<h1>Community-Wide Rules</h1>
					<div class="list">
						<ol>
							<li>Don't spam ANYTHING.</li>
							<br>
							<li>On Gmod servers, don't spawn large dupes or randomly spawn in dupes you don't the size of with the normal dupe tool. Use the advanced dupe for that if it's available on the server.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Leaving the server to avoid punishment or to avoid a certain RP event is not allowed.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Bullying, harassment, and discrimination will not be tolerated. Doing it ironically or as a joke is acceptable as long as the other person knows that.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Do not interact with AFK players, their items, or anything that involves them until they return. On Gmod servers, this also includes players who aren't on the server at all.</li>
							<br>
							<li>On Gmod servers, you may prop block only if you have a keypad and/or fading door for other players to break in. Hiding the keypad so it's harder to get in is allowed. (Only applies to RP servers.)</li>
							<br>
							<li>Don't abuse bugs/glitches/exploits/etc. If you find one, report it to an admin or the server owner right away.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Hacking, DDoSing, or otherwise negatively or illegally interfering with a server (including threats) will not be tolerated, and doing so will result in a permanent ban without warning.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Joining with the intent of breaking rules and/or annoying admins instead of actually playing properly will not be tolerated and will result in a permanent ban without warning.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Players are granted a full refund on in-game items and/or money if they lose either of those things due to a bug, invalid kill, server crash, client game crash, or other means of dying or disconnecting that were not intentional by the client. (Does not protect against valid admin punishments.)</li>
