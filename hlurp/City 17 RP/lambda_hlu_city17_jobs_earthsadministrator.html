                <br>
                <li>Only use your weapon shipments in certain areas of the Citadel.</li>
                <br>
                <li>You cannot use weapons for self defense if there are 4 or more combine units on the server.</li>
                <br>
                <li>You can only deploy soldiers, guards, and elites if the situation calls for any of them. For example, don't send out elites to patrol early in the game and rebels have even shown activity yet, and don't send out soldiers to raid an apartment for a small violation. Use metrocops to patrol and raid until the rebels have started to become an effective resistance.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Breaking these rules could result in a job ban.</li>
