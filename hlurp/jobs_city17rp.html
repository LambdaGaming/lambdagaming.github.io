					<h2>In-Game Description:</h2>
					<p>The resistance leader is in charge of commanding the rebel force. It is their duty to recruit any refugees who are looking to fight the combine. It is recommended that you say hidden indoors and underground.

					</ul>
				</div>
				<div id="vortigaunt" style="display:none" class="list">
					<h1 style="text-align:center">Vortigaunt</h1>
					<h2>In-Game Description:</h2>
					<p>The vortigaunt is an alien species that has been enslaved by the Combine alongside humanity. Vorts are able to shoot fatal amounts of electricity from their hands and are very strong, allowing them to do things faster and easier compared to humans.

					<br>

						<li>Follow orders from either the Combine or rebels.</li>

					</ul>
				</div>
				<div id="governmentman" style="display:none" class="list">
					<h1 style="text-align:center">Government Man</h1>
					<h2>In-Game Description:</h2>
					<p>The Government Man for City 17 RP works like a spy. He can choose a side (combine or rebels) and help them by giving them advantages such as hidden base locations and attack plans. The Government Man can take two sides at once if he pleases. Players can turn on the Government Man if they have reason to believe he is a spy for the enemy, but they must have solid evidence before killing.</p>
					<br>
					<h2>Duties:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Give either the Combine, Rebels, or both teams advantages by giving away secrets and base locations.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>

						<li>Has access to entire map under certain circumstances.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Has ability to teleport back and forth between two points.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>

						<br>
						<li>Do not abuse the teleportation system in any way.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div id="metrocop" style="display:none" class="list">
					<h1 style="text-align:center">Metrocop</h1>
					<h2>In-Game Description:</h2>
					<p>Civil Protection is essentially the Combine's thought police in all urban areas on Earth, including City 17. Part of the Combine Overwatch, CPs are ordinary human volunteers who have "willingly" joined the Combine, either for more privileges, such as additional food, better living conditions, an increase in authority and status over others, or out of genuine sympathy and identification with the Combine's aims. As such, they are not bio-mechanically modified in any way, unlike the two other Overwatch units.</p>
					<br>
					<h2>Duties:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Keep the city safe from any threats.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Patrol certain sectors of the city.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Set up checkpoints in high traffic areas so citizens have to show an ID before passing through.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h2>Special Job-Specific Items:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Has access to sidearms and SMGs.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Has ability to setup checkpoints as well as patrol wherever they please, unless otherwise assigned a specific sector by the Earth Admin.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h2>Job-Specific Rules/Tips:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Don't discharge your weapons unless it is REALLY necessary.</li>
						<br>
						<li>You can prop block for checkpoints, but you still need to let players through if you know they live in that certain sector. Don't think it's ok to not let someone through.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Ask permission from either the overwatch commander or a server admin before setting up a non-permanent checkpoint. This is only in place so players don't set up checkpoints in areas that shouldn't have one.</li>
						<br>
						<li>You are not allowed to patrol in areas that you know players like to hide out. Doing so would be considered metagaming and could result in a temporary job ban. This includes checking out the hidden rebel base and the sewers because you think rebels are hiding there. In other words, you need solid evidence that rebels are currently hiding there before you move in to raid.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div id="overwatchsoldier" style="display:none" class="list">
					<h1 style="text-align:center">Overwatch Soldier</h1>
					<h2>In-Game Description:</h2>
					<p>Overwatch Soldiers are the basic trans-human infantry units of the Combine Overwatch, composing the backbone of the Combine's military presence on Earth. In contrast to Civil Protection, whose duties are to enforce order within suppressed population centers, soldiers of the Overwatch are tasked with more hazardous actions requiring skill and tact: from patrolling the treacherous borders of Combine-controlled territory to raiding Resistance-held strongholds.</p>
