        <p>As a cook, it is your job to make sure all personnel are well fed at all times. There are certain locations in the facility reserved specifically for you to set up a cooking station. This job is set up so people can still eat, even when you are not around. For example, if you are setting up a cafe in Sector C, but the Survey Team wants some food in Sector A, you can place a microwave in Sector A, and automatically get money every time someone gets food from it. You can also use non-microwave food that can be bought from the F4 menu and sold to customers.</p>
