        <h2 style="color:#FF5900">In-Game Description:</h2>
        <p>The Government Man (or G-Man) walks around the facility looking at the conditions of certain things. You should first take a tour with the administrator or head of security, then later talk with the Safety Advisor about things that could be improved. Once you are done with that, you can continue to walk around the facility asking the administrator questions if needed. Once you are free, you can spend the rest of your time looking at certain parts of the facility by yourself.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 style="color:#FF5900">In the Event of an Emergency:</h2>
        <p>If something such as a cascade happens, it is your responsibility to call in the military. To do this, simply send out an advert (in sort of a "roleplay" form) stating that the military is being called in to contain the situation. Once a server admin sees the advert, one admin must become an HECU Captain. Once there is an HECU Captain on the server, the admin can then announce that he is now recruiting anyone who wants to be a marine. Once there is a HECU squad formed, they can then proceed to stock up on weapons and ammo in the on-site base, and proceed to enter the facility. As government man, you also have the ability to choose what the marines do. They can either 1) Rescue all personnel and take them up for questioning, or 2) Kill all personnel and cover up the incident from the rest of the world. Keep in mind, though, that if the HECU Captain does not agree, he doesn't have to follow your orders, so you are pretty much only suggesting in this case.</p>
