                    <h1>Black Mesa RP Job: Facility Administrator</h1>
                    <p><u><a href="https://lambdagaming.github.io/hlurp/bmrp/lambda_hlu_bmrp_admincommands.html">Note: For a list of commands that go along with this job, click here.</a></u></p>
                    <div class="list">
                        <h2>In-game Description:</h2>
                        <p>The Administrator is pretty much the opposite of the visitor. He has access to the entire facility, as well as control over everyone in it. As an administrator, you can escort visitors, command part of the military, call for fire drills, and, if needed, call for an emergency evacuation or lockdown. You talk with your on site-military and security to keep people safe, and you occasionally walk around the facility to check on things. Finally, and most importantly, it is your job to schedule Anomalous Materials tests on Xen specimens using the Anti-Mass Spectrometer (AMS). A test can only happen once every 2 hours real-time, so if you think you are not ready with the specimen, don't schedule a test. </p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Events:</h2>
                        <p>The administrator can't be in charge of natural disasters like earthquakes and meteor storms, but he can ensure safety if something happens. To call a lockdown, simply type /lockdown into chat. If a lockdown is called, an alarm will sound server-wide, alerting all players. If an emergency evacuation is called, it is your job to go to the Sector C security room and activate the fire alarm. You can then make an advert explaining why people need to evacuate.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Duties:</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Keep order throughout the facility.</li>

                            <li>Have all personnel write reports of what they are doing, and have them delivered to you to look at.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Special Job-Specific Items:</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Has access to the lockdown command.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Has command over whole facility.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Has ability to arrest players.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Job-Specific Rules/Tips:</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Don't abuse your power. Just because you are in charge of the facility doesn't mean you have to boss everyone around and ruin the game experience for others.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Don't spam lockdowns. Only call them if you feel that lives are in danger.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Don't tell the whole military what to do. It's ok if you are telling one or two marines to check something out, but bossing around the Captain or the whole military could result in bad things!</li>
                        </ul>
