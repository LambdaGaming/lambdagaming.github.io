        <p>As a Survey Team member, your Job is to use the Sector A teleportation unit to teleport to Xen and bring crystal samples and live aliens back to Black Mesa for the Biochemist to research.

Your job could be highly dangerous, so call the head of the Survey Team if you need assistance. Lastly, you are required to report to the AMS in Sector C when the administrator wants to perform a test if there is no Head of Survey Team to insert the specimen.</p>
