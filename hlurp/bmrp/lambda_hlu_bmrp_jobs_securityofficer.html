                        <h2 style='color:#FF5900'>In-Game Description:</h2>
                        <p>As a Security Officer, your job is to protect Black Mesa from anything that may put anyone's life at risk or anything that may get in the way of working. You are permitted to set up checkpoints if you are alone in a Sector and feel that you need it. You can also request HECU assistance if things really get out of hand. If you do call them in though, they have permission to command you, whether you like it or not.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2 style="color:#FF5900">Duties:</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Keep the facility safe from any threats.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Patrol certain sectors of the facility.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Set up checkpoints in high traffic areas so personnel have to show an ID before passing through.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <h2 style="color:#FF5900">Special Job-Specific Items:</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Has access to Black Mesa side arms.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Has ability to patrol wherever they please, unless otherwise assigned a specific sector by the head of security.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Has ability to call in HECU support.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Has ability to set up checkpoints. (This is the only job group that can prop block for RP purposes.)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <h2 style="color:#FF5900">Job-Specific Rules/Tips:</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Don't discharge your weapons unless it is ABSOLUTELY necessary.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>You can prop block for checkpoints, but you still need to let players through once they show their ID. Don't think it's ok to not let someone through.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Ask permission from either the head of security or a server admin before setting up a checkpoint. This is only in place so players don't set up checkpoints in areas that shouldn't have one.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Breaking these rules could result in a job ban.</li>
                        </ul>
