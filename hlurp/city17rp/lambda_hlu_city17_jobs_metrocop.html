                        <p>Civil Protection is essentially the Combine's thought police in all urban areas on Earth, including City 17. Part of the Combine Overwatch, CPs are ordinary human volunteers who have "willingly" joined the Combine, either for more privileges, such as additional food, better living conditions, an increase in authority and status over others, or out of genuine sympathy and identification with the Combine's aims. As such, they are not bio-mechanically modified in any way, unlike the two other Overwatch units.</p>

                        <h2 style="color:#FF5900">Duties:</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Keep the city safe from any threats.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Patrol certain sectors of the city.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Set up checkpoints in high traffic areas so citizens have to show an ID before passing through.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <h2 style="color:#FF5900">Special Job-Specific Items:</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Has access to sidearms and SMGs.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Has ability to patrol wherever they please, unless otherwise assigned a specific sector by the Earth Admin.</li>

                            <li>Has ability to call in Combine Soldier support.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Has ability to set up checkpoints. (This is the only job group that can prop block for RP purposes.)</li>

                        <h2 style="color:#FF5900">Job-Specific Rules/Tips:</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Don't discharge your weapons unless it is REALLY necessary.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>You can prop block for checkpoints, but you still need to let players through if you know they live in that certain sector. Don't think it's ok to not let someone through.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Ask permission from either the overwatch commander or a server admin before setting up a non-permanent checkpoint. This is only in place so players don't set up checkpoints in areas that shouldn't have one.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>You are not allowed to patrol in areas that you know players like to hide out. Doing so would be considered metagaming and could result in a temporary job ban. This includes checking out the hidden rebel base and the sewers because you think rebels are hiding there. In other words, you need solid evidence that rebels are currently hiding there before you move in to raid.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Breaking these rules could result in a job ban.</li>
                        </ul>
