            <p>The Government Man for City 17 RP works like a spy. He can choose a side (combine or rebels) and help them by giving them advantages such as hidden base locations and attack plans. The Government Man can take two sides at once if he pleases. Players can turn on the Government Man if they have reason to believe he is a spy for the enemy, but they must have solid evidence before killing.</p>
