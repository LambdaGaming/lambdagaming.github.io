            <p>Elites are tougher, achieve better accuracy with their weapons, and inflict more overall damage than regular soldiers do. They typically carry Overwatch Standard Issue Pulse Rifles, and are able to use the weapon's secondary fire Energy Ball.
                They use this advantage without hesitation and with deadly accuracy. Elites also may be picked to protect the Earth's Admin's office.</p>
