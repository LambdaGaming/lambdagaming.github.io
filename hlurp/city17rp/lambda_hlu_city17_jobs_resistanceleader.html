        <p>The resistance leader is in charge of commanding the rebel force. The resistance leader is also in charge of the rocket at the rebel base and when it launches. While in City 17, however, it is the resistance leader's duty to recruit any refugees who are looking to fight the combine. It is recommended that you say hidden indoors and underground. Since you are one of the highest ranking members of the resistance, you cannot afford to get yourself captured and forced by the combine to give out resistance intel.</p>
