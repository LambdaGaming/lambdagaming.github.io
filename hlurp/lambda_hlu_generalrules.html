                <li>Along with these rules, be sure to read the community-wide rules which can be found by clicking <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/lambdagamingdedicatedservers/community-wide-rules/general-community-wide-rules">here</a></li>
                <br>
                <li>Do not randomly kill other players. This does not apply to Outland RP, or Civilians in City 17 RP. However, if you kill as a Civilian, the Combine either has a right to kill you, imprison you, or force you to join them.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Don't break the Fair Game Rule. This means players cannot kill their killer for revenge, and players cannot return to a raid or other similar RP event unless they have a member of their squad or gang still participating in the event.</li>
                <br>
                <li>If you are being held at gun point and are unarmed, you have to do what the gunman says. You may attempt to trick the gunman and run away, but doing this may result in the gunman shooting you, which then will be considered a valid kill. You may also attempt to kill the gunman if you have a weapon in your weapon slot.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Not doing your job could get you temporarily banned from that particular job, and all related jobs.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Being corrupt is not allowed, no matter what roleplay situation you are in.</li>
