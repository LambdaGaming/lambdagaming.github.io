				<div id="visitor" class="list">
					<h1 style="text-align:center">Visitor</h1>
					<h2>In-Game Description:</h2>
					<p>The Visitor is not employed and requires a security escort to get into the Black Mesa Research Facility. This is recommended if you are new to the server.</p>
					<br>
					<h2>Duties:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Learn about the server. (If new to the gamemode.)</li>
						<br>
						<li>Take a tour of the map with the Administrator, Head of Security, or HECU Captain. (If new to the map.)</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h2>Special Job-Specific Items:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>None</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h2>Job-Specific Rules/Tips:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Don't stay a visitor for a long time. Once you know the basics of the roleplay, get started working at the facility.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Don't avoid security to try and sneak your way into the facility.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div id="facilityadmin" style="display:none" class="list">
					<h1 style="text-align:center">Facility Administrator</h1>
					<p style="text-align:center"><u><a href="https://lambdagaming.github.io/hlurp/admin_commands_bmrp.html">Note: For a list of commands that go along with this job, click here.</a></u></p>
					<h2>In-game Description:</h2>
					<p>The Administrator is pretty much the opposite of the visitor. He has access to the entire facility, as well as control over everyone in it. As an administrator, you can escort visitors, command part of the military, call for fire drills, and, if needed, call for an emergency evacuation or lockdown. You talk with your on site-military and security to keep people safe, and you occasionally walk around the facility to check on things. Finally, and most importantly, it is your job to schedule Anomalous Materials tests on Xen specimens using the Anti-Mass Spectrometer (AMS). A test can only happen once every 2 hours real-time, so if you think you are not ready with the specimen, don't schedule a test. </p>
					<br>
					<h2>Events:</h2>
					<p>The administrator can't be in charge of natural disasters like earthquakes and meteor storms, but he can ensure safety if something happens. To call a lockdown, simply type /lockdown into chat. If a lockdown is called, an alarm will sound server-wide, alerting all players. If an emergency evacuation is called, it is your job to go to the Sector C security room and activate the fire alarm. You can then make an advert explaining why people need to evacuate.</p>
					<br>
					<h2>Duties:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Keep order throughout the facility.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Ensure safety of all personnel.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Give informational tours to visitors who want one.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Command all science, maintenance, and security personnel.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Listen to the Government Man and Safety Advisor for suggestions and concerns.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Have all personnel write reports of what they are doing, and have them delivered to you to look at.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h2>Special Job-Specific Items:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Has access to the lockdown command.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Has command over whole facility.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Has ability to arrest players.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h2>Job-Specific Rules/Tips:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Don't abuse your power. Just because you are in charge of the facility doesn't mean you have to boss everyone around and ruin the game experience for others.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Don't spam lockdowns. Only call them if you feel that lives are in danger.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Don't tell the whole military what to do. It's ok if you are telling one or two marines to check something out, but bossing around the Captain or the whole military could result in bad things!</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div id="researchanddevelopment" style="display:none" class="list">
					<h1 style="text-align:center">Research and Development</h1>
					<h2>In-Game Description:</h2>
					<p>As a member of the Research and Development team, your job is to research and develop new technology for use in the B.M.R.F. Use of advanced Wiremod and Gterminal is highly recommended for this job. This job is similar to the Weapons Engineer, except for the fact this job uses simple Wiremod instead of Wiremod turrets and explosives.</p>
					<br>
					<h2>Duties:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Make anything as long as it doesn't involve weapons or advanced wiremod technology.</li>
						<br>
						<li>When making something remember these things: 1) Does it not have flaws? 2) Does it function correctly? 3) Is it useful for anything? If all of these answers are "yes" for your creation, then you can show it off to the whole facility!</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h2>Special Job-Specific Items:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Certain Wiremod tools that aren't available to any other job.</li>

					<h2>In-Game Description:</h2>
					<p>Your main job is to study the crystals the Survey Team brings back from Xen. If you have the time, you can study other biological and living things. You can study living things by using your NPC spawner tool. This tool is known throughout Black Mesa as a mobile-mini-dimensional-portal. It allows you to spawn any NPC in the game. Don't abuse it by spamming the NPC count though; you may be banned from this job for doing so.</p>
					<br>

					<h2>In-Game Description:</h2>
					<p>As a Service Official, your job is to clean up the facility by painting over spills/stains, inspecting various machines, extinguishing fires, and cleaning up stray props. This is the only job that has unlimited access to maintenance areas around the facility. You are equipped with a fire extinguisher in case things get out of hand. If a fire does break out, contain it. If you see a fire that is spreading, call in for more service personnel help you contain the fire. You are also required to report any fires to the safety advisor or administrator.</p>
					<br>

					<ul>
						<li>Extinguish any fires that may break out.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Tidy up the facility by putting crates back in order, putting wet floor signs down if needed, etc.</li>

				<div id="governmentman" style="display:none" class="list">
					<h1 style="text-align:center">Government Man</h1>
					<h2>In-Game Description:</h2>
					<p>The Government Man (or G-Man) walks around the facility looking at the conditions of certain things. You should first take a tour with the administrator or head of security, then later talk with the Safety Advisor about things that could be improved. Once you are done with that, you can continue to walk around the facility asking the administrator questions if needed. Once you are free, you can spend the rest of your time looking at certain parts of the facility by yourself.</p>
					<br>
					<h2>In the Event of an Emergency:</h2>
					<p>If something such as a cascade happens, it is your responsibility to call in the military. To do this, simply send out an advert (in sort of a "roleplay" form) stating that the military is being called in to contain the situation. Once a server admin sees the advert, one admin must become an HECU Captain. Once there is an HECU Captain on the server, the admin can then announce that he is now recruiting anyone who wants to be a marine. Once there is a HECU squad formed, they can then proceed to stock up on weapons and ammo in the on-site base, and proceed to enter the facility. As government man, you also have the ability to choose what the marines do. They can either 1) Rescue all personnel and take them up for questioning, or 2) Kill all personnel and cover up the incident from the rest of the world. Keep in mind, though, that if the HECU Captain does not agree, he doesn't have to follow your orders, so you are pretty much only suggesting in this case.</p>
