				<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Apartment Raid:</h2>
				<p>Apartment raids are usually conducted by Civil Protection units to raid apartments known for housing potential rebels. Civil Protection has the option to either kill or capture anyone seen in the apartments that were raided. What happens to them after the raids is up to Earth's Administrator (or City Administrator).</p>
				<hr>
				
				<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Judgement Waiver:</h2>
				<p>Judgement waivers are city-wide alarms activated by Earth's Administrator (or City Administrator), they signal Combine units to be on alert for a specific person, and they signal citizens to stay indoors or be killed. This event is only to be activated if the Earth's Administrator needs to find a person of interest in a hurry.</p>
				<hr>
				
				<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Autonomous Judgement:</h2>
				<p>Autonomous judgements are city-wide alarms activated by Earth's Administrator (or City Administrator), they signal Combine units to kill every citizen they come into contact with. It also signals citizens to run for their life, as there is no negotiating your way out of being killed once this alarm is activated.</p>
				<hr>
				
				<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Citadel Detonation:</h2>
				<p>The citadel detonation event is an event that is triggered by rebelling citizens, who have managed to force their way into the citadel and "upload self-destruct codes". Once the countdown has been activated, combine forces must enter the citadel and try to cancel the countdown  before it's too late. If the countdown is successful, the RP will change to Outland RP.</p>
				<hr>
				
				<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Zombie Invasion:</h2>
				<p>The zombie invasion event spawns random types of zombies in the sewers of the city, some of which being near the rebel base.</p>
				<hr>
				
				<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Citadel Power Core Failure:</h2>
				<p>The power core failure event causes some jail cell doors in the citadel to temporarly unlock and open, allowing prisoners to escape.</p>
				<hr>
				
				<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Headcrab Canister Failure:</h2>
				<p>The headcrab canister failure event causes headcrab canisters containing normal headcrabs to launch and fall down on populated areas of the city.</p>
