				<ol>
					<li>Along with these rules, be sure to read the community-wide rules which can be found by clicking <a href="https://lambdagaming.github.io/community_rules.html">here.</a></li>
					<br>
					<li>Do not randomly kill other players. This does not apply to Outland RP, or Civilians in City 17 RP. However, if you kill as a Civilian, the Combine either has a right to kill you, imprison you, or force you to join them.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Don't kill players just because they killed you, and don't keep an event going after you died unless members of your team are still taking part in the event.</li>
					<br>
					<li>If you are held at gunpoint, you can do whatever is necessary to survive as long as it doesn't break any other rules.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Not doing your job could get you temporarily banned from that particular job, and all related jobs.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Being corrupt is not allowed, no matter what roleplay situation you are in.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Players who have stayed through the gamemode transition have the right to reserve their job spot for the next gamemode segment if their character from the previous gamemode had a similar duty to the one the player wants to reserve. (Example: If you were HECU when the nuke dropped on Black Mesa, you can reserve your spot as combine soldier or civil protection for City 17 RP.)</li>
					<br>
					<li>Media such as screenshots or videos of RP events may be used for RP purposes (such as evidence in court) if the media can be proven to be from the same session it is being used in.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Using information received outside to influence your actions inside of the RP is not allowed. For example, telling someone over Discord or steam chat that you are being arrested at a certain location, and having that person show up to save you is not allowed.</li>
