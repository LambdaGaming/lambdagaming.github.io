				<ol>
					<li>Along with these rules, be sure to read the community-wide rules which can be found by clicking <a href="https://lambdagaming.github.io/community_rules.html">here.</a></li>
					<br>
					<li>On Black Mesa RP, randomly killing players is not allowed until the resonance cascade happens. On City 17 RP and Outland RP, random killing is allowed between two teams, but team killing is only allowed if your teammate did something to negatively affect you.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Don't kill players just because they killed you, and don't keep an event going after you died unless members of your team are still taking part in the event. This is to prevent endless battles from happening.</li>
					<br>
					<li>If you are held at gunpoint, you can do whatever is necessary to survive as long as it doesn't break any other rules.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Not doing your job correctly could get you temporarily banned from that particular job, and all related jobs.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Players who have stayed through the gamemode transition have the right to reserve their job spot for the next gamemode segment if their character from the previous gamemode had a similar duty to the one the player wants to reserve. (Example: If you were HECU or security when the nuke dropped on Black Mesa, you can reserve your spot as combine soldier or civil protection for City 17 RP.)</li>
					<br>
					<li>Media such as screenshots or videos of RP events may be used for RP purposes (such as evidence for a crime) if the media can be proven to be from the same session it is being used in.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Using meta information obtained outside of the game is allowed, but it is recommended you use the in-game text chat when participating in major RP events to help admins prove innocence and guilt if a rule is broken.</li>
					<br>
					<li>On City 17 RP and Outland RP, as a Combine role, you cannot kill or arrest resistance leaders who are disguised as a friendly unless you have obtained proof in the RP that they are a rebel.</li>
					<br>
					<li>On City 17 RP, as a Combine role, you are not allowed to raid a rebel base just because you know one exists on the map. You need solid RP evidence that rebels are there before you can raid it.</li>
