		<h1>HLU RP Rules</h1>
		<div class="main">
			<h3>General Rules</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Along with these rules, be sure to read the <a href="../community_rules.html">community-wide rules.</a></li>
				<br>
				<li>Don't kill players just because they killed you, and don't keep an event going after you died unless members of your team are still taking part in the event. This is to prevent endless battles from happening.</li>
				<br>
				<li>If you are held at gunpoint, you can do whatever is necessary to survive as long as it doesn't break any other rules.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Not doing your job correctly could get you temporarily banned from that particular job, and all related jobs.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Players who have stayed through the gamemode transition have the right to reserve their job spot for the next gamemode segment if their character from the previous gamemode had a similar duty to the one the player wants to reserve. (Example: If you were HECU or security when the nuke dropped on Black Mesa, you can reserve your spot as combine soldier or civil protection for City 17 RP.)</li>
				<br>
				<li>Media such as screenshots or videos of RP events may be used for RP purposes (such as evidence for a crime) if the media can be proven to be from the same session it is being used in.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Prop surfing is not allowed no matter what. Prop pushing is allowed as long as it doesn't damage other players or their property. Prop climbing is only allowed if it realistically fits in the RP. Example: Prop climbing to get over a fence and break into someone's home is allowed, but prop climbing into the air to escape the police is not allowed.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Black Mesa RP Rules</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Randomly killing players is not allowed until the resonance cascade happens. Exceptions can be made if you are doing it as a one-time thing that fits within the RP.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>City 17 RP Rules</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Randomly killing is allowed between two teams, but team killing is only allowed if your teammate did something to negatively affect you.</li>
				<br>
				<li>As a Combine role, you cannot kill or arrest resistance leaders who are disguised as a friendly unless you have obtained proof in the RP that they are a rebel.</li>
				<br>
				<li>As a Combine role, you are not allowed to raid a rebel base just because there were people there last time. You need solid RP evidence that rebels are there before you can raid it.</li>
				<br>
				<li>As a scientist, you can choose whatever side you want, but you can't go off on your own and refuse to work with both sides.</li>
				<br>
				<li>As a vortigaunt, you must follow any and all orders given to you, whether its from a citizen or the Combine.</li>
				<br>
				<li>As an Overwatch Guard or Elite, do not leave the citadel area unless you are ordered to by the Earth Admin.</li>
				<br>
				<li>As Earth Admin, you can only deploy soldiers, guards, and elites if the situation calls for them. For example, don't send out elites to patrol early in the game when rebels haven't even shown activity yet, and don't send out soldiers to raid an apartment for a small violation. Use metrocops to patrol and raid until the rebels have started to become an effective resistance.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Outland RP Rules</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Randomly killing is allowed between two teams, but team killing is only allowed if your teammate did something to negatively affect you.</li>
				<br>
				<li>As a Combine role, you cannot kill or arrest resistance leaders who are disguised as a friendly unless you have obtained proof in the RP that they are a rebel.</li>
			</ol>
