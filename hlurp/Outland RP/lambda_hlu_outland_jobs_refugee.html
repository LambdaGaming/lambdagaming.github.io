            <p>Refugees are civilians of City 17 (and City 24) who have decided to fight against the combine. During City 17 RP and City 24 RP, refugees are to start the uprising by crafting weapons and fighting the Combine. During Outland RP, refugees have the option to act as guards for rebel bases, but they can also choose to work by themselves or other refugees to create their own separate rebellion.</p>
