				<h2 style="color:#ff5900">Half-Life Universe RP Introduction:</h2>
				<p>Welcome to the Lambda Gaming Half-Life Universe Roleplay server rules and guidelines. First off, it should be noted that our server is like no other out there, so we will do our best to make sure you know everything you need to have an enjoyable experience on the server. However, this guide is not perfect and does not discuss every single detail of the server, so if you have a question that wasn't answered here, feel free to ask in-game or on our <a href="https://discord.gg/9RGdUS2">Discord.</a> As the name suggests, this server covers some of the major events that have happened throughout the Half-Life series, hence the roleplay name "Half-Life Universe". There are 3 different gamemodes that are packed into one server: (1) Black Mesa RP, (2) City 17 RP, and (3) Outland RP.</p>
				<br><br>
				<h2 style="color:#ff5900">Black Mesa RP:</h2>
				<p>Black Mesa Roleplay, as you might have guessed, takes place at the Black Mesa Research Facility, a massive science facility located in the middle of the New Mexico desert. The facility has a wide variety of disciplines, but the main focus is teleportation and other research related to Xen, a border world located between universes.<br> Some of the jobs you can have at Black Mesa include Facility Administrator, Government Man, Security Officer, Survey Team Member, Biochemist, and HECU Marine. More details and the rest of the jobs for this RP can be found with the job rules and guidelines. Teamwork is extremely important in this RP. You will rarely find yourself in a situation that doesn't involve at least one other job.<br>The facility administrator is in charge of all staff. He can assign preset or custom tasks to certain jobs to help guide players on what to do. Players can also participate in events that can disrupt the workflow of the facility. These events are initiated by the government man.<br>Players also have a personal budget that they can spend on leisure items and scientific equipment. Funds can be earned by completing events and tasks, or selling unused research items.<br>Lastly, after a couple hours of this RP running, admins may start to initiate the cascade event. The details of this event are usually different each time, but the general idea is to gather players to do a large-scale test of an item at the AMS (anti-mass spectrometer) or some other large piece of testing equipment. Once the test happens, the facility will start to break down and hostile aliens will begin teleporting in and attacking players. Certain players will then be chosen to become HECU soldiers and raid the facility until the HECU captain can take control and nuke the facility. Once the HECU commander nukes the facility, the RP will transition to City 17 RP.</p>
				<br><br>
				<h2 style="color:#ff5900">City 17 RP:</h2>
				<p>City 17 RP takes the basic city parts of the Half-Life 2 storyline and turns it into a working roleplay environment. The main focus of City 17 RP is to either become a refugee and eventually take over the citadel using crafted weapons, become a loyal citizen and help the combine out by mining for them, become a recruit for the Combine and play your part protecting and serving Earth's Administrator, or become a government man and give secret information to one or both sides about their enemy to advance the war in your favor.<br>For the first 30 minutes of the gamemode running, a ceasefire will be in place, giving all parties a chance to get settled in before the action starts. If and when the resistance has formed enough people to storm the citadel, they will have to find a scientist, free them from the custody of the combine if need-be, and escort them to the detonation console to start the sequence. Once the sequence is activated, it will slowly turn everyone's screen gray and after about two minutes the citadel will explode and change the gamemode to Outland RP.<br>Throughout the RP, random events may pop up that will affect gameplay. Some of these events include a citadel power failure, which will temporarily open jail cell doors, a zombie invasion, where zombies raid the sewers and the rebel base, and a headcrab canister failure, which will cause a few headcrab canisters to launch and raid down on populated areas of the city.<br>Side note: If you are familiar with HL2RP, you are probably wondering why we chose the name City 17 RP. We did this simply because HL2RP tends to be more detailed and serious, and we chose to make this server semi-serious with less details that restrict player freedom, so we use a different name to avoid confusion.</p>
				<br><br>
				<h2 style="color:#ff5900">Outland RP:</h2>
				<p>Outland RP takes place in the outlands of the city after the citadel explodes. The first objective is for the rebels to keep fighting long enough to create a weak point in Combine defenses, allowing rebel forces to raid the Combine base and activate an orbiting satellite, which will then close the Combine portal. Once the Combine portal is closed, the RP will end and change to a wasteland map, indicating that the portal destruction affected the entire planet. The second objective is for the rebels to launch a rocket at their base to tap into the old Black Mesa satellite and close the Combine portal without causing mass destruction. To get the codes for launching the rocket, a rebel will have to search the map for it. It will either show up in a giant log, rebel computer, rebel crate, rebel generator, or concrete rubble. If the rebel holding the codes dies or disconnects before the rocket starts it's launch sequence, the codes will be hidden again for someone else to find. When launching the rocket, keep in mind that the Combine will know when one is activated, so be wise about your launch times. If the Combine stop a launch, rebels must wait 10 minutes before launching another rocket. If the rocket makes it into orbit and activates the satellite, the RP will end with an explosion and the server will close. Note that for the first 30 minutes of the gamemode running, a ceasefire will be in place, giving all parties a chance to get settled in before the action starts. During this time, both the combine portal closing and rebel rocket launch events will be disabled.</p>
