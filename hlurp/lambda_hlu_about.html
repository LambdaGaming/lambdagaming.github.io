						<h2 style="color:#ff5900">Half-Life Universe RP Introduction:</h2>
						<p>Welcome to the Lambda Gaming Half-Life Universe Roleplay server rules and guidelines. First off, it should be noted that our server is like no other out there, so we will do our best to make sure you know everything you need to have an enjoyable experience on the server, however, this guide is not perfect and probably does not include every detail the server has, so if you have a question that wasn't answered as you read through the guide, feel free to ask an admin and they will be glad to help! If you haven't figured it out already, this server covers some of the major events that have happened throughout the Half-Life series, hence the roleplay name "Half-Life Universe". There are 3 different types of roleplay that are packed into one server: (1) Black Mesa Roleplay, (2) City 17 Roleplay, and (3) Outland Roleplay. Each type of roleplay will be gone over as you continue to read through this guide.</p>
						<br><br>
						<h2 style="color:#ff5900">Black Mesa RP:</h2>
						<p>Black Mesa Roleplay, as you might have guessed, takes place at the Black Mesa Research Facility. The facility has a wide-variety of inventions and work fields, but the main focus is teleportation. The following is a list of some of the more important jobs you can have at Black Mesa: Administrator, Security Officer, Survey Team Member, and HECU Marine. More details and the rest of the jobs for this type of roleplay can be found with the job rules and guidelines. As players work as their chosen job to create objects using addons like Wiremod, PCMod, GTerminal, and other custom addons made specifically for this server, random events may occur where players will have to complete a task in order to fix an item that isnt working, such as a door, portal, or computer system. Players who have Biochemist or Weapons Engineer jobs can also request Xen materials from the survey team to craft items such as aliens and advanced weapons. The final event that will occur on BMRP will be the cascade event, where aliens teleport into the facility and the military is ordered to kill  or rescue any survivors. When the military takes over the facility, the HECU Captain can get permission from server admins and proceed to detonate the Thermonuclear Device, which will cause an explosion and change the map to one of four City 17 RP maps.</p>
						<br><br>
						<h2 style="color:#ff5900">City 17 RP:</h2>
						<p>City 17 RP is a type of roleplay that takes the basic city parts of the Half-Life 2 storyline and turns it into a working roleplay environment. The main focus of City 17 RP is to either become a refugee and eventually take over the citadel using crafted weapons, become a loyal citizen and help the combine out by mining for them, or become a recruit for the Combine and play your part protecting and serving Earth's Administrator. If and when the resistance has formed enough to kill Earth's Administrator and destroy the citadel, the refugees will have to enter the detonation codes for the citadel, which will then trigger an explosion and change the gamemode to Outland RP. Thoughout the RP, random events may pop up that will affect gameplay. Some of these events include a citadel power failure, which will temporarily open jail cell doors, a zombie invasion, where zombies raid the sewers and the rebel base, and a headcrab canister failure, which will cause a few headcrab canisters to launch and raid down on populated areas of the city.</p>
						<br><br>
						<h2 style="color:#ff5900">Outland RP:</h2>
						<p>Outland RP is the final type of roleplay the server has to offer. In this type of roleplay, the first objective is for the rebels to keep fighting long enough to create a weak point in Combine defenses, allowing rebel forces to raid the Combine base and activate an orbiting satellite, which will then close the Combine portal. Once the Combine portal is closed, the RP will end and change to a wasteland map, indicating that the portal desruction affected the entire planet. The second objective is for the rebels to launch a rocket at their base to tap into the old Black Mesa satellite and close the Combine portal without causing mass destruction. When launching the rocket, keep in mind that the Combine will know when one is activated, so be wise about your launch times. If the Combine stop a launch, rebels must wait 10 minutes before launching another rocket. If the rocket makes it into orbit and activates the satellite, the RP will end with an explosion and the server will close.</p>

						<h2 style="color:#ff5900">Half-Life Universe RP Conclusion:</h2>
						<p>As stated before, this guide does not cover every little detail on the server. So, if you have a question that wasn't answered in this guide, please ask an admin and they will be happy to help you! Also, if you would like something to be added, changed, etc, feel free to leave a suggestion on our Steam group page. Not all suggestions will be put into the server (obviously), but there will always be a response to all of the comments stating if the item is being put in or not.</p>
