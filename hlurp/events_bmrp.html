                    <h1>HLU RP: Black Mesa RP Events</h1>
                    <div class="list">
						<hr>
                        <h2>Fire Drill:</h2>
                        <p>Fire Drills are routine tests of the Black Mesa Research Facility's emergency alarm system. They are usually called by the administrator without warning, making everyone treat the situation as a real emergency. When the alarm goes off, everyone is to report topside. Security is to patrol the sectors for any personnel who didn't hear or see the alarm going off. (This is usually the case in the back of Sector C) Security Officers should always be the last people to exit the facility. Once everyone is out, the administrator can let everyone back in and let them know it was only a drill.</p>
						<hr>

                        <h2>Resonance Cascade:</h2>
                        <p>Resonance cascades happen when molecules of an object shake so violently, that it basically opens a portal allowing alien creatures to enter Earth. The only way a cascade can happen on the server is when the survey team finds a crystal that the administrator wants to test on. Once the crystal is inserted into the test chamber beam, an admin will activate a hidden button, triggering the cascade event. The event consists of alien NPCs spawning throughout the facility, fires spawning, elevators breaking down, pipes bursting, and the player in the test chamber being teleported to Xen. Once this has all happened, that is when the government man can take charge and call in the military.</p>
						<hr>
						
                        <h2>Facility Lockdown:</h2>
                        <p>A facility lockdown occurs when something happens that could potentially harm or kill personnel. The lockdown will sound an alarm server-wide and display a message above the player's HUD. Only the facility administrator can call these lockdowns.</p>
						<hr>
						
                        <h2>Portal Failure:</h2>
                        <p>The portal failure event disables the portal startup button. To fix the portal, a service official must go up to the sparking portal console and use his wrench on it until a message appears saying the portal has been fixed.</p>
						<hr>
						
                        <h2>Door Failure:</h2>
                        <p>The door failure event prevents some electric doors from opening. To make the door operational again, a service official must find the generator powering the doors and start it back up by pressing his/her use key.</p>
						<hr>
						
                        <h2>Employee Death:</h2>
                        <p>The employee death event spawns a dead NPC that a medic must revive to get a reward. After the NPC is revived, he will teleport away and the medic will be rewarded. An Government Man NPC will then teleport to sector D, where the facility administrator will have to talk with him about the incident.</p>
						<hr>
						
                        <h2>Xen Breach:</h2>
                        <p>The xen breach event spawns a random Xen NPC at a random lab in the facility. HECU marines, security, and survey team members will have to work together to end the threat and prevent any personnel from being injured.</p>
						<hr>
						
                        <h2>Biohazard Leak:</h2>
                        <p>The biohazard leak event spawns random radioactive elements at industrial parts of the facility. The biochemist will be required to come in with special containment barrels and secure the elements before they kill any personnel. The biochemist is the only job that doesn't take radioactive damage.</p>
						<hr>
						
                        <h2>Lost Crystal:</h2>
                        <p>The lost crystal event spawns a Xen crystal at a random point in the facility, mostly in restrooms and storage areas. To get a reward, survey team members must take the crystal to the portal console.</p>
						<hr>
						
                        <h2>HECU Weapon Request:</h2>
                        <p>The HECU weapon request event spawns an NPC at sector D. The weapons engineer has to speak with this NPC to see what weapon he would like. The weapons engineer can either accept or deny this request. If he denies it, the NPC will leave. If he accepts it, the NPC will stay until given the desired weapon. All weapons that are requested by the NPC are able to be crafted with the weapons engineer crafting table.</p>
						<hr>
						
                        <h2>Server Failure:</h2>
                        <p>The server failure event causes all GTerminal and PCMod systems to stop working. This effect will last until a technician goes to the main server and reboots it with his/her use key.</p>
