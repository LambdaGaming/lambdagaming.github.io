            <p>The resistance leader is in charge of commanding the rebel force. The resistance leader is also in charge of the rocket at the rebel base and when it launches. It is recommended that you say hidden indoors and underground. Since you are one of the highest ranking members of the resistance, you cannot afford to get yourself captured and forced by the combine to give out resistance intel. Also note that without the resistance leader, the rocket cannot be launched, so their protection must be ensured at all times.</p>
