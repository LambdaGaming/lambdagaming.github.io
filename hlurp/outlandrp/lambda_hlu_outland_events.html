            <h2 style="color:#FF5900">Rocket Launch:</h2>
            <p>A rocket launch occurs when the rebels activate the sattelite rocket's launch sequence at the rebel base. Once the sequence is activated, a countdown will start for 5 minutes. If Combine units cannot destroy the rocket before it reaches orbit using the cancellation button at the rebel base, the rocket will begin to tap into the old Black Mesa sattelite, causing a chain reaction to close the Combine portal and thus ending the RP.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 style="color:#FF5900">Portal Shutdown:</h2>
            <p>A portal shutdown is when rebels get into the Combine base and activate the portal closing sequence. The if the Combine cannot cancel the sequence before it's complete using the cancel button, the portal will close and the RP will change back to Black Mesa RP.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 style="color:#FF5900">Combine Raids:</h2>
            <p>Raids performed by the Combine can occur at any time. Typically when a raid is conducted, it is on a known rebel base or hideout, and helicopers and ground units are usually sent out to either capture or kill anyone inside the base.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 style="color:#FF5900">Random Disasters:</h2>
            <p>Random disasters are admin-activated events that can occur without any warning at any time. Some random disasters include a headcrab canister malfunction, zombie infestation, and wild fires.</p>
