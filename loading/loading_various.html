			<h3>About This Server:</h3>
			<p>As the name implies, this server hosts a variety of gamemodes, most of which are round-based. We usually stick to one gamemode until a few players start requesting a different one, then we hold a vote.</p>
			<h3>List of Current Gamemodes:</h3>
			<p>Cops and Runners, Dropzone, Flood, Homicide, Jazztronauts, Prop Hunt, Pirate Ship Wars Remix, Pirates Vs. Boners, Sledbuild, Stop it, Slender!, TTT, Trash Compactor, and Zombie Survival.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Notes:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>This server does not run 24/7. If you want to be notified the next time it opens, join the Discord. The link can be found on our Steam group page, which can be accessed by pressing !group in chat.</li>
				<br>
				<li>This server does not use FastDL due to host limitations. If you need the addons, type !addons in chat once you have loaded in.</li>
				<br>
				<li>The rules on the left side of this loading screen only cover rules for certain gamemodes. For community-wide rules, type !rules in chat.</li>
