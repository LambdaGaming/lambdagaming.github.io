			<h3>About This Server:</h3>
			<p>As the name implies, this server hosts a variety of gamemodes, most of which are round-based. We usually stick to one gamemode until a few players start requesting a different one, then we hold a vote.</p>
			<h3>List of Current Gamemodes:</h3>
			<p>Cops and Runners, Darkest Days, Dropzone, Flood, Homicide, Jazztronauts, Prop Hunt, Pirate Ship Wars Remix, Sledbuild, Stop it, Slender!, TTT, Trash Compactor, and Zombie Survival.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Notes:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>This server does not run 24/7. If you want to be notified the next time it opens, join the Discord. The link can be found by typing !discord in chat.</li>
				<br>
				<li>If you are missing the addons, you may need to enable multiplayer downloads in the game options. If you prefer to manually download them, you can type !addons in chat once you have loaded in.</li>
			</ul>
