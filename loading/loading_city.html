			<h4>Basic Rules:</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Randomly killing is only allowed if the players you are targeting have done something negative to you during the same lifetime.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Don't kill players just because they killed you, and don't keep an event going after you died unless members of your team are still taking part in the event. This is to prevent endless battles from happening.</li>
				<br>
				<li>You can commit crimes as any job, but you still have to perform your assigned duties.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Newly elected mayors are granted a 10 minute cooldown to get things setup. Protesting/raiding/threatening/killing the mayor during this time is not allowed.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Prop surfing is not allowed no matter what. Prop pushing is allowed as long as it doesn't damage other players or their property. Prop climbing is only allowed if it realistically fits in the RP.</li>
				<br>
				<li>You are only allowed to respawn your personal vehicle under very specific conditions, such as when it is permanently destroyed or no mechanic is available to fix it.</li>
				<br>
				<li>You cannot obstruct any public entities at any time. See the item catalog for a full list of public entities.</li>

			<h4>About This Server:</h4>
			<p>CityRP is basically a more in-depth version of DarkRP. There are a few things that make us different from other CityRP servers, however. First, we have very little crime jobs. This is because most jobs, including police and government, have access to illegal items, and all civilian jobs have the ability to rob banks. This allows players to keep an element of surprise since there's no separate job to give away your intentions. It also gives players more freedom to do what they want as the job they prefer. Second, we have no VIP or donator restrictions. Every item and job you see on the server is available for anyone to use. There's a lot to take in, so if you need help with anything, don't be afraid to ask an admin.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Notes:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>This server does not run 24/7. If you want to be notified the next time it opens, join the Discord. The link can be found by typing !discord in chat.</li>
				<br>
				<li>If you are missing the addons, you may need to enable multiplayer downloads in the game options. If you prefer to manually download them, you can type !addons in chat once you have loaded in.</li>
			</ul>
