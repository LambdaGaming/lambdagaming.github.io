			<h3>General Server Rules:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Randomly killing is allowed as long as the players you are targeting have done something negative to you during the same lifetime.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Don't kill players just because they killed you, and don't keep an event going after you died unless members of your team are still taking part in the event.</li>
				<br>
				<li>If you are held at gunpoint, you can do whatever is necessary to survive as long as it doesn't break any other rules.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Players can commit crimes as any job, but still must perform their assigned duties.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Newly elected mayors are granted a 10 minute cooldown to get laws setup. Raiding/threatening/killing the mayor during this time is not allowed.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Equipping weapons from your inventory after being weapon checked is not allowed unless you are no longer in sight of the people who checked you.</li>
				<br>
				<li>If you steal an item, you must somehow make it known to the owner that it was stolen. This doesn't necessarily mean the owner has to know it was you who stole it.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>About This Server:</h3>
			<p>CityRP is basically a more in-depth version of DarkRP. There are a few things that make us different from other CityRP servers, however. First, we have very little crime jobs. This is because most jobs, including police and government, have access to illegal items, and all civilian jobs have the ability to rob banks and deposit boxes. This allows players to keep an element of surprise since there's no separate job to give away your intentions. Second, we have no VIP or donator restrictions. Every item and job you see on the server is available to use, which may be a bit overwhelming for some players. If you need help with anything, don't be afraid to ask an admin.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Notes:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>This server does not run 24/7. If you want to be notified the next time it opens, join the Discord. The link can be found on our Steam group page, which can be accessed by typing !group in chat.</li>
				<br>
				<li>This server does not use FastDL due to host limitations. If you need the addons, type !addons in chat once you have loaded in.</li>
				<br>
				<li>The rules on the left side of this loading screen only cover the major and most enforced rules. For a full list, press F1 while in-game.</li>
			</ul>
