			<h4>About This Server:</h4>
			<p>CityRP is about roleplaying as a person with a specific job with your own set goals, but there are a few things that make us different from other CityRP servers.<br><br>First, we have very little crime jobs. This is because all jobs, including police and government, have access to illegal items, and all civilian jobs have the ability to commit high-level crimes such as robbing banks. This allows players to keep an element of surprise since there isn't a separate job that gives away your intentions. It also gives players more freedom to do what they want as the job they prefer.<br><br>Next, we do not have VIP or donator restrictions. Every item and job you see on the server is available for anyone to use.<br><br>Lastly, the mayor is much more powerful than you might expect. He has the ability to change various aspects of the server to manage the city's economy.<br><br>There's a lot to take in, so if you need help with anything, don't be afraid to ask.</p>
