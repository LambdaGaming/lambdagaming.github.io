			<h3>Basic Rules:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Randomly killing is allowed as long as the players you are targeting have done something negative to you during the same lifetime.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Don't kill players just because they killed you, and don't keep an event going after you died unless members of your team are still taking part in the event. This is to prevent endless battles from happening.</li>
				<br>
				<li>If you are held at gunpoint, you can do whatever is necessary to survive as long as it doesn't break any other rules.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Players can commit crimes as any job, but still must perform their assigned duties.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Newly elected mayors are granted a 10 minute cooldown to get things setup. Protesting/raiding/threatening/killing the mayor during this time is not allowed.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Equipping weapons from your inventory after being searched with the handheld metal detector is not allowed unless you are no longer in sight of the people who checked you.</li>
				<br>
				<li>If you steal a car you must somehow announce to the owner that it was stolen. If you fail to do so and the owner respawns it, they will not be at fault.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>About This Server:</h3>
			<p>CityRP is basically a more in-depth version of DarkRP. There are a few things that make us different from other CityRP servers, however. First, we have very little crime jobs. This is because most jobs, including police and government, have access to illegal items, and all civilian jobs have the ability to rob banks. This allows players to keep an element of surprise since there's no separate job to give away your intentions. It also gives players more freedom to do what they want as the job they prefer. Second, we have no VIP or donator restrictions. Every item and job you see on the server is available for anyone to use. There's a lot to take in, so if you need help with anything, don't be afraid to ask an admin.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Notes:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>This server does not run 24/7. If you want to be notified the next time it opens, join the Discord. The link can be found by typing !discord in chat.</li>
				<br>
				<li>If you are missing the addons, you may need to enable multiplayer downloads in the game options. If you prefer to manually download them, you can type !addons in chat once you have loaded in.</li>
			</ul>
