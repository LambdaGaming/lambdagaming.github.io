			<h3>General Server Rules:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>On Black Mesa RP, randomly killing players is not allowed until the resonance cascade happens. On City 17 RP and Outland RP, random killing is allowed between two teams, but team killing is only allowed if your teammate did something to negatively affect you.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Don't kill players just because they killed you, and don't keep an event going after you died unless members of your team are still taking part in the event.</li>
				<br>
				<li>If you are held at gunpoint, you can do whatever is necessary to survive as long as it doesn't break any other rules.</li>
				<br>
				<li>On City 17 RP and Outland RP, as a Combine role, you cannot kill or arrest resistance leaders who are disguised as a friendly unless you have obtained proof in the RP that they are a rebel.</li>
				<br>
				<li>On City 17 RP, as a Combine role, you are not allowed to raid a rebel base just because you know one exists on the map. You need solid RP evidence that rebels are there before you can raid it.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>About This Server:</h3>
			<p>This server goes through the entire Half-Life storyline inside a roleplay environment starting with Black Mesa RP, continuing to City 17 RP, and ending with Outland RP. All of these segments are run a bit differently compared to most other servers, so don't be afraid to ask an admin about what to do.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Notes:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>This server does not run 24/7. If you want to be notified the next time it opens, join the Discord. The link can be found by typing !discord in chat.</li>
				<br>
				<li>If you are missing the addons, you may need to enable multiplayer downloads in the game options. If you prefer to manually download them, you can type !addons in chat once you have loaded in.</li>
				<br>
				<li>The rules on the left are only the major ones. For the full list of server-wide rules and other info, type !rules in chat once you have spawned in.</li>
