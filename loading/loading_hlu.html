			<h3>General Server Rules:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Do not randomly kill other players. This does not apply to Outland RP or City 17 RP as long as the kills aren't team kills.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Don't kill your killer for revenge and don't return to a raid or other similar RP event unless you have a member of your squad or gang still participating in the event.</li>
				<br>
				<li>If you are being held at gun point, you have to do what the gunman says unless you are armed and have the ability to fight back.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Not doing your job could get you temporarily banned from that particular job, and all related jobs.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Being corrupt is not allowed, no matter what roleplay situation you are in.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Players who have stayed through the gamemode transition have the right to reserve their job spot for the next gamemode segment if their character from the previous gamemode had a similar duty to the one the player wants to reserve. (Example: If you were HECU when the nuke dropped on Black Mesa, you can reserve your spot as combine soldier or civil protection for City 17 RP.)</li>

			<h3>About This Server:</h3>
			<p>As you can probably tell from the name, this server goes through the entire Half-Life storyline inside a roleplay environment starting with Black Mesa RP and ending with Outland RP, with City 17 RP (or HL2RP as some call it) being the half-way point. All of these segments (especially the last two) are run a bit differently compared to most other servers, so don't be afraid to ask an admin about what to do.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Notes:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>This server does not run 24/7. If you want to be notified the next time it opens, join the Discord. The link can be found on our Steam group page, which can be accessed by pressing !group in chat.</li>
				<br>
				<li>If you are missing the addons, you may need to enable multiplayer downloads in the game options. If you prefer to manually download them, you can type !addons in chat once you have loaded in.</li>
			</ul>
