			<h3>Server Rules:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Don't build in the middle of high traffic areas. Examples of high traffic areas: Roads, footpaths, train tracks, spawn, any other areas that are regularly accessed by players and aren't regularly used for bases.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Don't abuse buildmode. Example of abuse: noclipping to get into someone's base and killing them, or walking into an enemy base with god mode on to see the layout of the base without risk of dying.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Don't damage WAC Aircraft/Star Wars vehicles until they are off of the ground and flying.</li>
			</ol>
