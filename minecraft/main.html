					<p>Note: Along with these rules, be sure to read the community-wide rules which can be found <a href="https://lambdagaming.github.io/community_rules.html">here.</a> Overhead images of the server maps can be found <a href="https://lambdagaming.github.io/minecraft/images.html">here.</a></p>

						<h1>General Rules:</h1>
						<p>These rules apply to all Minecraft servers except the Unbalanced servers.</p>
						<ol>
							<li>PVP is enabled. You can choose to base with someone or by yourself, who your allies and enemies are is up to you.</li>
							<br>
							<li>You can only use reasonable force to raid a base. For example, using TNT to blow up a small wooden hut or burning a mansion just to loot a chest isn't allowed, but using TNT to blow a hole in the side of a mansion to gain access to a chest is allowed. Ask an admin if you are unsure whether or not your raid method is reasonable.</li>
							<br>
							<li>You don't have to announce a raid, but you can only raid/loot bases that are occupied, unless they have been declared abandoned by the owner.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Using game exploits of any kind is not allowed.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Griefing is not allowed. Refer to the raiding rules above for what you're allowed to do if you want to mess with someone.</li>
						</ol>
						<br>
						<h1>Unbalanced Rules:</h1>
						<p>These rules only apply to the original Unbalanced server.</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Causing damage to a protected structure or causing damage to a player who is inside a protected structure is not allowed.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Players can declare something as a protected structure as long as it is owned by them and the structure has no weapons in or around it.</li>
						</ol>
						<br>
						<h1>Unbalanced 2 Rules:</h1>
						<p>These rules only apply to the Unbalanced 2 server.</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Causing damage to a protected structure or causing damage to a player who is inside a protected structure is not allowed.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Players can declare something as a protected structure as long as it is owned by them and the structure has no weapons in or around it.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Using the red matter bomb without superadmin permission is not allowed.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Using chance cubes near active bases is not allowed.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Structures owned by a disconnected player are to be considered protected structures.</li>
