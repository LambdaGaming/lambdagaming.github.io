				<h1>Vanilla, RLCraft, OG Modded, & Modded 2 Rules:</h1>
				<ol>
					<li>PVP is enabled. You can choose to base with someone or by yourself, who your allies and enemies are is up to you.</li>
					<br>
					<li>You can only use reasonable force to raid a base. For example, using TNT to blow up a small wooden hut or burning a mansion just to loot a chest isn't allowed, but using TNT to blow a hole in the side of a mansion to gain access to a chest is allowed. Ask an admin if you are unsure whether or not your raid method is reasonable.</li>
					<br>
					<li>You don't have to announce a raid, but you can only raid/loot bases that are occupied, unless they have been declared abandoned by the owner.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Using game exploits of any kind is not allowed.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Griefing is not allowed. Refer to the raiding rules above for what you're allowed to do if you want to mess with someone.</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<h1>Unbalanced 1 & 2 Rules:</h1>
				<ol>
					<li>Causing damage to a protected structure or causing damage to a player who is inside a protected structure is not allowed.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Players can declare something as a protected structure as long as it is owned by them and the structure has no weapons in or around it. (Vanilla or other small-scale weapons used to defend the structure from NPCs are allowed.)</li>
					<br>
					<li>You must get permission from an admin before setting off anything that may destroy protected areas that you can't see such as large nuclear bombs or destabilizing a black hole. If you don't know the kind of damage a particular item does, look it up or ask an admin before using it.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Structures owned by a disconnected player are to be considered protected structures until the owner returns.</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<h1>Earth Rules:</h1>
				<ol>
					<li>All players are given admin to allow for more building freedom. Don't abuse this power.</li>
					<br>
					<li>If you want to go to war with another player, both of you must agree to the war and both of you must stay in survival mode for the duration of the war.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Damaging another players property is not allowed unless you are currently at war with them.</li>
				</ol>
