                <li>Along with these rules, be sure to read the community-wide rules which can be found by clicking <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/lambdagamingdedicatedservers/community-wide-rules/general-community-wide-rules">here</a></li>
                <br>
                <li>Don't mass RDM. (Killing multiple people without reason.) You may, however, randomly kill players if they have done something negative to you. For example, if someone kills your friend and you see him, you may kill him without punishment if he hasn't died since the incident. Keep in mind, however, that law enforcement can still intervene in the RP, and arrest you for murder.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Don't break the Fair Game Rule. This means players cannot kill their killer for revenge, and players cannot return to a raid or other similar RP event unless they have a member of their squad or gang still participating in the event.</li>
                <br>
                <li>If you are being held at gun point and are unarmed, you have to do what the gunman says. You may attempt to trick the gunman and run away, but doing this may result in the gunman shooting you, which then will be considered a valid kill. You may also attempt to kill the gunman if you have a weapon in your weapon slot.</li>
                <br>
                <li>You may attack other players (but not kill) without warning, however the victim is then allowed to return fire and kill you, or run away and call the police.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Not doing your job could get you either fined in-game, or temporarily banned from that particular job.</li>
                <br>
                <li>You must have a proper reason to want to kill the mayor. Killing the mayor without discussing things you may be unhappy about (such as laws) will be considered fail RP.</li>
                <br>
                <li>You cannot have double keypads or fading doors for extra security.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Don't use a job to just use it's abilities, meaning don't go Gun Dealer just to have easy access to weapons for yourself, or go Medic just to heal yourself for free. If you wish to do this, you must stay as that job for a while and serve other players.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Prop surfing is not allowed no matter what, and prop climbing is only allowed as long as it doesn't give you an RP advantage over someone else. (For example, prop climbing into the air to get away from a shooter would not be allowed. Prop climbing over a fence to get into someones house would be allowed.)</li>
                <br>
                <li>Making a base in the sky above the city is not allowed. Making a base on a rooftop is allowed, but the base must be accessible to all players at all times, meaning ramps or stairs must be available for everyone. Your rooftop base may still have a fading door to prevent players from coming in, though.</li>
                <br>
                <li>If a player is basing near your base, you are permitted to raid and kill anyone in the nearby base as long as you give some sort of warning to them beforehand.</li>
                <br>
                <li>What qualifies as boundaries of your base is up to you, but the bigger you make it the harder it will be to control and maintain. Also keep in mind that the mayor and police force can decide how and where bases are set up.</li>
                <br>
                <li>You must have a valid reason to hire a hitman, doing it randomly with no aparent reason is not allowed.</li>
