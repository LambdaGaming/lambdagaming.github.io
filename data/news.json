		"date": "June 1, 2025",
		"changes": [
			"All food that was spawned by the cook through the F4 menu is now spawned through the cooking stove that was originally only used for fish. Each food item takes 30 seconds to cook and up to 4 items can be cooked at the same time.",
			"Cops are now rewarded money for destroying certain contraband items. The amount of money given depends on the value of the item.",
			"Events are random once again and no longer go through the job broker, except this time players who can participate in the event can vote yes/no to start it, instead of being forced to deal with it when they didn't want to.",
			"Restricted spawning of the mayor's limo and Bearcat to the mayor and active SWAT officers respectively."
		],
		"deletions": [
			"Removed the old smuggling system. With the recent changes to the event system and smuggler NPC it's become more and more redundant and harder to maintain.",
			"Removed the Ford Taurus. It was a redundant police car and apparently it was never added to the civilian car dealer for whatever reason, so there wasn't much reason to keep it."
