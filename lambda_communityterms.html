		<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Out of Community:</h2>
		<b><u>Chronet:</u></b> Refers to a Garry's Mod roleplay community that the owner and co-owner of Lambda Gaming used to play on before they made the CityRP server. It is constantly joked about as Chronet has a sketchy history, which includes but is not limited to, admin abuse, admins being bribed to unban players, ludicrous rules that don't need to be there such as it being against the rules for someone to defy police orders in the RP,  the owner ignoring pretty much everything that goes on in the community that suggests he's only in it for the money, admins allowing certain groups of people to break major server rules without consequence, and false claims of the community's main RP server being made from 100% custom content. Due to Chronet's sketchy admins and ludicrous rules, OP decided to make his own CityRP server in mid 2016 that aimed to avoid everything that Chronet did wrong. It is also joked about that Chronet has beef with Lambda Gaming, despite us as a group never making contact with them, and they probably don't even know that we exist.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>Ronsons:</u></b> Refers to a group of people inside the Chronet community that has been rumored to successfully bribe admins to unban members of their group after being banned for randomly killing players. When on the server, the Ronsons tended to base in the industrial warehouses of rp_rockford_v1a, usually the ones with one-way windows, and kill anyone who gets too close.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>Bus Ride Incident:</u></b> Refers to a time on Chronet where the co-owner of Lambda Gaming was a bus driver and overheard a coversation about Chronet admins apparently taking bribes to unban players.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>Woody's Got Wood Incident:</u></b> Refers to a time on Chronet where a random player set up a stage across from city hall on rp_rockford_v1a and began to mic spam the entirety of woody's got wood, and despite mic spamming being strictly enforced, most admins didn't seem to care this was going on.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>Corrupt Mayor Incident:</u></b> Refers to a time on Chronet where the mayor, along with his secret service agents, went to the cabins on rp_rockford_v1a and grew weed for profit, despite it being against server rules for government officials to be corrupt, the mayor and his men were left alone, proving yet again that Chronet admins are corrupt themselves.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>Fish Mugging Incident:</u></b> Refers to a time on Chronet where the owner and co-owner of Lambda Gaming were held at gunpoint while fishing at the dock and were forced to hand over 200 dollars each to the gunman. After they paid the 200, the gunman left and was never seen or heard from again. To this day, this tragic event still haunts OP and Rez.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>Car Stuck Incident:</u></b> Refers to a time on Chronet where the co-owner of Lambda Gaming was attempting to help the owner of Lambda Gaming after he got stuck on the side of the road. As Rez backed his bus down the road to winch OP out of the dirt, a cop pulls him over for driving backwards. Rez then has to explain to the cop why he was driving backwards, all while OP was patiently sitting there stuck. It is still a mystery as to how the cop didn't see OP stuck there in the first place.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>RV Weed Incident:</u></b> Refers to a time on Chronet where the owner of Lambda Gaming was out on the outskirts of rp_rockford_v1a with his RV when a citizen came up to him and asked him if he was growing weed. OP said no and the citizen left. OP then quickly ran inside the RV and inventoried his weed, and just seconds later, the police show up to inspect the RV. They found nothing and left.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>Chinese Army Incident:</u></b> Refers to a time on Chronet where the co-owner of Lambda Gaming was taken over by a script kiddie, who managed to cover his entire screen with a mysterious picture of the Chinese Army after being raided by the police for suspected drug use. The picture made Rez's game completely unusable, and he was forced to use task manager to close it. To this day, we still don't know who did this, how they did it, or where the picture even came from. Google searches to match this picture have been unsuccessful, and it is still unknown if the police raid and the picture are related in any way.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>Bank Heist:</u></b> Refers to plan devised in mid 2016 by multiple Lambda Gaming admins, including the owner and co-owner, to join Chronet and pull off a successfull bank robbery. They prepared themselves with weapons and some pre-planning, which consisted of setting fire to a suburbs house to distract police and buy time, and having an inside man leave the PD doors unlocked so lockpicking wouldn't waste any time. Unfortunatly, the Lambda Gaming CityRP server was made just days before this event was supposed to go down, and the heist was called off to run tests on the new server. Today, some admins are still willing to join Chronet one last time to pull off this heist, as they still have their weapons stored in their inventories, but due to modern Chronet's community dying off rather quickly, it is unlikely this dream will ever become a reality.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>2 Hour Ban Incident:</u></b> Refers to a time the owner of Lambda Gaming decided to return to Chronet to see how it's held up over the years in mid 2018. He was suprised to see the server was only half-full, when all 64 player slots were usually filled and you would have to wait up to an hour for an open slot to join. After he went to look to see what he still had left in his inventory, he became an ERU (Emergency Response Unit) and drove around the map in his ambulance. After a while, (to no suprise) he was suddenly held at gunpoint in the industrial area while still in the ambulance. The gang members shot up the ambulance to the point where it was no longer drivable, and told OP to get out. He refused and started chat spamming memes. After about a minute of chat spam, OP was banned from the server for 2 hours for not only spamming chat, but also refusing to get out of the car while being held at gunpoint. After that, OP laughed to himself, knowing that doing those two things on Lambda Gaming would never result in a ban, or hardly any type of punishment at all.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>Goldstar BMRP:</u></b> Refers to a Garry's Mod roleplay community that OP used to play on before Lambda Gaming was created. This server had a pretty friendly playerbase and the server was well put together and run, but like Chronet, this server also had some pretty stupid rules. Due to this, OP stopped playing on it and made his own BMRP server along with Lambda Gaming.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>Xenogen:</u></b> Refers to a Garry's Mod sandbox community that OP, Kit, Keem, Shiro, and Cuddles used to play on. Much like the other two mentioned above, this server too had stupid rules, along with abusive admins. Due to this, OP went on to create O.P. Gaming Sandbox.
		<br><br>
		<h2 style="color:#FF5900">HLU RP:</h2>
		<b><u>Sector C Beta:</u></b> Refers to the HLU RP map rp_sectorc_beta, the first map to be put on the original BMRP server, and a favorite among the Garry's Mod community for it's size and accurate representation of the Black Mesa facility.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>BMRP:Classic:</u></b> Short for Black Mesa Roleplay, the first gamemode in the rotation of the three gamemodes on HLU RP that takes place in the Black Mesa Research Facility, the primary setting of Half-Life. More info on this RP can be found under the Half-Life Universe RP section of the website.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>BMRP:Cascade:</u></b> The cascade variant of BMRP takes the jobs from BMRP:Classic and puts them in a gamemode that plays similar to SCP: Secret Laboratory. Players are rewarded with DarkRP money that they can use in the other two gamemodes of HLU RP when they escape the facility, get kills, and/or survive until the end of the round. More info on this RP can be found under the Half-Life Universe RP section of the website.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>City 17 RP:</u></b> Can also be referred to as City 24 RP, depending on the map. The second gamemode in the rotation of the three gamemodes on HLU RP that takes place in City 17, the primary setting of Half-Life 2. The main objective in this gamemode is for refugees to overthrow the combine and destroy the citadel while loyal citizens and combine forces attempt to stop them. More info on this RP can be found under the Half-Life Universe RP section of the website.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>Outland RP:</u></b> The third gamemode in the HLU RP rotation that takes place in the outlands of City 17, the primary setting of Half-Life 2: Episode 2. The main objective in this gamemode is for rebels to defend their base from the Combine while they prepare their rocket for launch to close the main Combine portal. More info on this RP can be found under the Half-Life Universe RP section of the website.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>Atomic Map:</u></b> Also known as gm_atomic and the wasteland map. Refers to an alternate ending to Outland RP where players are taken to the map gm_atomic and are forced to survive as scattered forces until the end of the server session.
		<br><br>
		<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Miscellaneous:</h2>
		<b><u>The Warranian Civil War:</u></b>Also known as the First Civil War, the Great Civil War and the Rockford Civil War. Refers to the very first event on the CityRP server that divided the playerbase and the map into two. After a thorough investigation of the chat log from that day, it has been determined that the cause of the civil war was the mayor making protesting illegal. After a long effort, the civil war ended with the rebels killing the mayor and most of his men. The rest of his men surrendered to the rebels and the civil war was officially declared over by the rebel leader. A memorial was then constructed across from city hall in honor of those fallen. A screenshot of this memorial can still be found in the server screenshots section of the website. After this incident, a server rule was put in place to prevent this from happening again, but was later removed.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>The Hoboville Incident:</u></b> Refers to a time on the Simple DarkRP server where 5 players became hobos and took over half the city, while the other half built a wall to keep the hobos separated. After this session, many attempts were made to recreate the rooftop houses, forcing OP to lower the max allowed hobos.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>The Hobo Incident:</u></b> Not to be confused with the Hoboville Incident, also known as the sky building rule. Refers to a time on the Simple DarkRP server where two hobos built a base in the sky that was later found out to be inaccessible without noclipping. As a result of this, a new rule was put in place forbidding bases to be built in the sky.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>The One-Way Door Incident:</u></b> Refers to a time on CityRP where players barracaded themselves inside a house and used a one way fading door to gain an unfair advantage against a SWAT raid. They could see out, but SWAT couldn't see in, making it extremely hard to make accurate shots for SWAT. After this, a rule was put in place forbidding one-way doors to be used at all on the server.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>The Hacking Squeaker Incident:</u></b> Refers to a time on the Simple DarkRP server in early 2018 where a squeaker used the classic source engine aimbot hack to kill everyone on the map. He was quickly banned and never heard from again.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>The Admin Demote Incident:</u></b> Refers to a time on the Simple DarkRP server in early 2018 where a player joined and proceeded to hack into ULX and demote all of the admins, including offline admins and superadmins. He then proceeded to walk up to OP and say "It seems the server is mine now.". OP then went over to the server console and manually kicked him. He never bothered joining back.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>The Accidental Kick Incident:</u></b> Refers to a time on CityRP in mid 2017 where OP mistakenly kicked a random after he spawned a dupe and the server started lagging. After the kick, OP realised it wasn't the random's dupe, but one of Brill's that was causing the server lag. The random joined back and OP apologised, but the random left again a few minutes later and never came back.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>The Entity Removal Incident:</u></b> Refers to a time on the CityRP server in early 2019 where a player joined the server and instantly used a lua script to remove every single entity on the map, including doors and elevators. He was quickly banned and the map was reloaded.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>The Attempted Hacking Incident:</u></b> Refers to a time on the CityRP server in early 2019 where a player joined and attempted to excecute lua through the remote console. OP quickly realised what he was up to and banned him for attempting to hack.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>The DDoS Incident:</u></b> Refers to the first and currently the only time that one of Lambda Gaming's servers was DDoS'ed. The DDoS, which happened in mid 2017 on the CityRP server, came from a friend of a community admin. The admin was proven to have nothing to do with it, infact the DDoSer never even joined any of Lambda Gaming's servers, leading many to believe that he was just doing it for the fun of it and not out of spite or revenge.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>The DeathKitty Incident:</u> Also known as the blackmailing incident and the leaking incident. Refers to a backfired plan made up by a Lambda Gaming admin to steal CityRP server files for his own use. The admins friend hacked into the server to get the files, but somehow they got out of hand and ended up in his friend's hands. His friend then proceeded to blackmail OP into demoting two other community admins or the server files will be leaked onto the internet. OP never agreed or refused to do this. The situation ended with the blackmailer being reported to Valve, the leaker being reported to Valve, and the admin recieving a large punishment. To this day, it is still unknown if the server files were actually leaked or if the blackmailer was bluffing.</b> 
		<br><br>
		<b><u>The News Cameraman Theory:</u></b> Refers to a theory made up by Rez that suggests that the CityRP news cameraman owns everything that his camera points at, including players.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>The Mayor Paradox:</u></b> Refers to a paradox made up by Rez that suggests that the CityRP mayor could give himself unlimited rule and power by making the I.A. Agent illegal, and thus making it impossible for the mayor to be fired, since under server rules the I.A. Agent isn't allowed to be corrupt.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>O.P. Gaming:</u></b> Refers to the old community that OP managed before Lambda Gaming. This community only hosted a Garry's Mod sandbox server, and had around 5 admins at it's playerbase peak.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>Randoms:</u></b> Refers to players who join the server and aren't part of the community. Randoms are often joked about as either joining the server but not spawning in due to long load times, joining the server then leaving a few seconds after spawning in without saying a word, or starting to hack the server the moment they spawn in and don't leave until they are banned.
		<br><br>
