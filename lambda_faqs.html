					<h3>Q: What is this community about?</h3>
					<p>A: We are a non-profit gaming community. We host our own game servers, mostly consisting of Garry's Mod roleplay servers. We do not run our servers 24/7.</p>
					<hr>

					<h3>Q: How do I become an admin?</h3>
					<p>A: You will eventually get admin if you show you are loyal to the community, and have been playing on our servers frequently.</p>
					<hr>

					<h3>Q: What are the community ranks?</h3>
					<p>A: The community ranks are as follows: User, Member, Admin, Superadmin.</p>
					<h4>Users:</h4>
					<p> Users are normal players (or randoms as we usually call them) that aren't part of our Steam group and don't join our servers regularly. Users have no power whatsoever in the community, but are still treated the same as members when it comes to admin support.</p>
					<h4>Members:</h4>
					<p>Members, on the other hand, are part of our Steam group and have joined our servers more than once. Members have no powers on servers. but they have the ability to post suggestions on  the group and get fast support through our Steam group's chat. Members are also eligible for becoming an admin if they continue to show their support for the community.</p>
					<h4>Admins:</h4>
					<p>Admins are members who have shown their loyalty to the community and join our servers very often. Admins have the responsibility of making sure players (and other admins) are following the rules. On Gmod servers, they have the access to admin tools such as noclip, god mode, teleportation, and punishments. In the community, admins have the ability to vote on certain things such as adding something new to a server, as well as create announcements and other community related privileges that normal members get.</p>
					<h4>Superadmins:</h4>
					<p>Superadmins are the highest ranking members of the community. Currently, there are only two members of the community who have superadmin access: [λG] O.P. Gλmer (commonly known as OP, owner of the community) and Revolver Oshawott (commonly known as Rez, co-owner of the community). Superadmins have access to all admin and superadmin commands on all servers. Superadmins are handpicked by the owner and aren't given out to just anyone.</p>
					<hr>
					
					<h3>Q: Is there any way to donate?</h3>
					<p>A: We currently do not accept any kinds of donations, that includes Steam items. This also means that we do not have donator or VIP only items, anything admins and members can use, everyone else can use as well.</p>
					<hr>
					
					<h3>Q: How are punishments handed out?</h3>
					<p><u>Note: Punishments are "reset" after 3 server sessions, meaning if you get a warning the first session and break another rule during the second session, you will be kicked without warning. Also, punishments aren't always handed out when rules are broken, most admins choose to strictly enforce major rules  (Such as the fair game rule and randomly killing on CityRP), and choose to enforce more minor rules only after they have been repeatedly broken by the same person. Basically, don't be annoying and follow the major rules and nobody will care if you break some minor rules from time to time.</u></p>
					<h4>Member and User Punishments:</h4>
					<p><u>Note: This punishment system only applies to members and users.</u></p>
					<div class="list">
						<ul>
							<li>When a player breaks a rule, they are usually given a single warning to not break another rule.</li>
							<br>
							<li>If a player breaks a rule after a warning, they will usually end up being kicked (and sometimes given a 5 minute ban to prevent them from instantly joining back).</li>
							<br>
							<li>If the player joins back and breaks a rule for the third time, they will usually be given a ban ranging from 20 minutes to the rest of the session. (All depending on the scale of the offense, for example repeated chat spam will most likely get you a less than 1 hour ban, whereas something such as RDM will most likely get you a session ban.)</li>
							<br>
							<li>If a player is still breaking rules after the session ban, it is then clear to us that they are nothing but trolls and don't need to be on the server, so they receive a permanent ban.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<br>		
					<h4>Admin and Superadmin Punishments:</h4>
					<p><u>Note: This punishment system only applies to admins and superadmins.</u></p>
					<div class="list">
						<ul>
							<li>First offense: Warning</li>
							<br>
							<li>Second offense: Temporary loss of server admin privileges until the next session.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Third offense: Wipe of inventory and/or DarkRP wallet. (Only applies to  the minecraft server and some RP servers.) Player gets a session ban on all other servers.</li>
							<br>
							<li>Fourth offense and above: Ranges from a session ban to an admin demote to a permanent ban depending on the situation.</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>What's the schedule for server openings?</h3>
					<p>OP, the community owner, is currently the host of all Lambda Gaming servers. That said, the servers are currently under a specific timeframe. On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday servers can run for up to 3 hours but will not run past 9:00 PM. On Friday and Saturday, they can run up to 6 hours but will not run past 1:00 AM. On Sunday, they can run up to 6 hours but will not run past 9:00 PM. Warnings will be given at least 10 minutes before closing time to let players finish their current task. Servers will not be open publicly after closing time unless there is a bug or other issue that needs addressed at that moment.</p>
