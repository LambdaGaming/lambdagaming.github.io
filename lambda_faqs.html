					<h1>General Community FAQs</h1>
					<hr>
					<h3>Q: What are the community ranks?</h3>
					<p>A: The community ranks are as follows: User, Member, Moderator, Admin, Superadmin.</p>
					<div class="list">
						<h4 style="text-align:center">Users:</h4>
						<p> Users are normal players (or randoms as we usually call them) that aren't part of our Steam group and don't join our servers regularly. Users have no power whatsoever in the community, but are still treated the same as members when it comes to admin support.</p>
						<h4 style="text-align:center">Members:</h4>
						<p>Members, on the other hand, are part of our Steam group and have joined our servers more than once. Members have no powers on servers. but they have the ability to post suggestions on  the group and get fast support through our Steam group's chat. Members are also eligible for becoming an admin if they continue to show their support for the community.</p>
						<h4 style="text-align:center">Moderators:</h4>
						<p>Moderators (or mods for short) are members who join our servers very often but aren't quite ready for admin yet. They have the responsibility of helping players who need it.</p>
						<h4 style="text-align:center">Admins:</h4>
						<p>Admins are members who have shown their loyalty to the community and join our servers very often. Admins have the responsibility of making sure players (and other admins) are following the rules. On Gmod servers, they have the access to admin tools such as noclip, god mode, teleportation, and punishments. In the community, admins have the ability to vote on certain things such as adding something new to a server, as well as create announcements and other community related privileges that normal members get.</p>
						<h4 style="text-align:center">Superadmins:</h4>
						<p>Superadmins are the highest ranking members of the community. Currently, there are only two members of the community who have superadmin access: [λG] O.P. Gλmer (commonly known as OP, owner of the community) and Revolver Oshawott (commonly known as Rez, co-owner of the community). Superadmins have access to all admin and superadmin commands on all servers. Superadmins are handpicked by the owner and aren't given out to just anyone.</p>
					</div>
					<hr>
					
					<h3>Q: Is there any way to donate?</h3>
					<p style="text-align:left">A: We currently do not accept any monetary donations. This also means that we do not have donator or VIP only items. Any RP item that admins and members can use, everyone else can use as well.</p>
					<hr>
					
					<h3>Q: How are punishments handed out?</h3>
					<p style="text-align:left">A: Most punishments are handed out on a case-by-case basis. The majority of admins tend to only enforce major rules such as things that would affect RP events. Breaking a few minor rules here and there probably won't even get you a warning as long as you aren't annoying about it. If you do break a major rule though, you will most likely get a warning, then a kick, and then a ban if you continue to do the same thing. Instead of receiving a kick, admins will get a temporary demote for breaking rules like this. Finally, if you're a new player and instantly start breaking rules the moment you spawn in, chances are you'll get a perma-ban without warning because that really isn't worth anyone's time.</p>
					<hr>
					
					<h3>Q: What's the schedule for server openings?</h3>
					<p style="text-align:left">A: OP, the community owner, is currently the host of all Lambda Gaming servers. That said, there is currently no set schedule, as he is currently pretty busy. Just make sure to check the Discord for openings or friend OP on steam so he can tell you directly when a server opens.</p>
					<hr>

					<h3>Q: Why aren't any servers 24/7?</h3>
					<p style="text-align:left">A: As stated above, OP is the current host of all servers, and paying for a 24/7 server isn't really an option for him right now. Along with that, and also as stated above, OP is busy with a lot of things including classes and personal projects, and converting the Gmod RP servers (the most popular servers among the community) to support a 24/7 playerbase would take a considerable amount of time to complete.</p>
