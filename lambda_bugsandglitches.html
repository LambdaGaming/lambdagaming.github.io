		<p>No server is perfect, and we make no exception. While on any of our servers, you may come across a bug or two. Below is a current list of all bugs, glitches, and/or exploits that have yet to be resolved. If you find a bug, glitch, or exploit on any of our servers, report it to an admin or on the Steam group.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h1 style="color:#ff5900">Garry's Mod:</h1>
		
		<h2 style="color:#ff5900">Some weapons are deformed and invisible.</h2>
		<p>This glitch is extremely random and usually only happens when the server temporarily freezes to load a car model and a player is physgunning something. It is sometimes fixed with a client game restart, other times it goes away on its own.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<h2 style="color:#ff5900">Windows and props are glossy and white.</h2>
		<p>This is a glitch that seems to only happen on certain maps, but if this does happen to you, simply type "mat_specular 0" in your game console. This command will disable reflections until you restart your game or reset the value to 1. Be aware that entering this command will temporarily freeze your game while it loads, and could potentially crash it depending on hardware.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<h2 style="color:#ff5900">There are notifications in the corner of my screen saying something is creating script errors.</h2>
		<p>Script error notifications appear when a piece of code is activated and the server does not understand what is it supposed to do. Only server developers can fix script errors, so if you get one, copy the error report from your console and
			give it to the owner of the server.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<h2 style="color:#ff5900">All vehicles are deformed and look like scraps of metal.</h2>
		<p>This glitch only happens if your model detail setting is set to anything besides high. To fix simply open your video settings and reset the model detail to high. If it doesn't instantly fix make sure you clicked apply; and if that doesn't fix it relog onto the server.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<h1 style="color:#ff5900">Minecraft (Modded Only):</h1>
		
		<h2 style="color:#ff5900">My game crashes half way through loading.</h2>
		<p>This typically occurs when your game runs out of memory. To fix this, go to the technic launcher settings in the top right corner and increase the amount of RAM your game is allowed to use. You may have to download the 64 bit version of java for this to work.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<h2 style="color:#ff5900">I get random lag when I didn't the session before.</h2>
		<p>This is most likely a cache problem. To fix this, locate at delete your technic cache folder. By default, it should be located at "C:/[username]/AppData/roaming/.technic". Depending on hardware, this could also be the result of a new processor-intensive mod being added that slows down your game. If this appears to be the case, the only fixes would be to lower your minecraft quality settings and install optifine.</p>
