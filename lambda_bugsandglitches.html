					<h1>Bugs and Glitches</h1>
					<p>Below is a current list of all known bugs and glitches. If you find a bug or glitch on any of our servers that isn't already listed here, report it to an admin or on the Steam group. If you find an exploit, please report it privately to a superadmin.</p>
					<br>
					<hr>

					<h1 style="color:#ff5900">Garry's Mod:</h1>
					
					<h2 style="color:#ff5900">Some weapons are deformed and invisible.</h2>
					<p>This glitch is extremely random and usually only happens when the server temporarily freezes to load a car model and a player is physgunning something. If you give it time, it will usually go away on it's own. If you want it gone without waiting you can restart your game.</p>
					<br><br>
					
					<h2 style="color:#ff5900">Windows and props are glossy and white.</h2>
					<p>This hasn't been reported since we ran the old version of rp_florida, but if this does happen to you, simply type "mat_specular 0" in your game console. This command will disable reflections until you restart your game or reset the value to 1. Be aware that entering this command will temporarily freeze your game while it loads, and could potentially crash it depending on hardware.</p>
					<br><br>
					
					<h2 style="color:#ff5900">There are notifications in the corner of my screen saying something is creating script errors.</h2>
					<p>Script error notifications appear when a piece of code is activated and the server does not understand what it's supposed to do. Only server developers can fix script errors, so if you get one, copy the error report from your console and give it to the owner of the server.</p>
					<br><br>
					
					<h2 style="color:#ff5900">All vehicles are deformed and look like scraps of metal.</h2>
					<p>This glitch only happens if your model detail setting is set to anything besides high. To fix simply open your video settings and reset the model detail to high. If it doesn't instantly fix make sure you clicked apply; and if that doesn't fix it relog onto the server.</p>
					<br><br>

					<h2 style="color:#ff5900">My game crashes when someone fires a gun.</h2>
					<p>Recent game updates should have fixed this problem, but if you experience this crash report it to OP so he can do further testing or report it directly to the Gmod devs if you know for sure what's causing it.</p>
					<br><br>

					<h2 style="color:#ff5900">I see pink and blacks squares and error signs everywhere.</h2>
					<p>You are missing required content. If you need the content, type !addons in chat. If you already have the content and are still experiencing this, the content is either part of a mountable game like Counter-Strike:Source or the addon corrupted itself and needs reinstalled.</p>
					<br><br>

					<h2 style="color:#ff5900">(CityRP) My farm plants aren't growing.</h2>
					<p>Some maps have weird skyboxes that don't consider themselves to be skyboxes. Try moving the plant around the map to see if it will grow in a particular spot. If it doesn't, contact a superadmin and they will refund you for the seeds.</p>
					<br><br>

					<h2 style="color:#FF5900">Why does my game randomly freeze and unfreeze?</h2>
					<p>This is usually caused by players spawning in new vehicles, since the server usually doesn't precache the models. This could also be the result of low memory on your PC, or a low-end processor taking the time to load resources.</p>
					<hr>
					<br>

					<h1 style="color:#ff5900">Minecraft (Modded Only):</h1>
					
					<h2 style="color:#ff5900">My game crashes half way through loading.</h2>
					<p>This typically occurs when your game runs out of memory. To fix this, go to the technic launcher settings in the top right corner and increase the amount of RAM your game is allowed to use. You may have to download the 64 bit version of java for this to work.</p>
					<br><br>
					
					<h2 style="color:#ff5900">I get random lag when I didn't the session before.</h2>
					<p>This is most likely a cache problem. To fix this, locate and delete your technic cache folder. By default, it should be located at "C:/[username]/AppData/roaming/.technic". Depending on hardware, this could also be the result of a new processor-intensive mod being added that slows down your game. If this appears to be the case, the only fixes would be to lower your minecraft quality settings and install optifine.</p>
					<br><br>

					<h2 style="color:#ff5900">(OG Modded) Certain blocks like chests move away when another player is nearby.</h2>
					<p>This happens when a player equips a weapon from the Enchant Changer mod. There is currently no fix other than to tell the player to unequip the sword from their hand and hotbar.</p>
