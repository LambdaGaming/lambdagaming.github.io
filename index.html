                    <h1>About Us:</h1>
                    <p>We are a small gaming community mainly composed of a group of friends who used to play on a bunch of different Garry's Mod servers and came together to form this community. We host our own game servers, mostly consisting of Garry's Mod roleplay servers and various modded Minecraft servers. We do not run our servers 24/7. Below is a list of all of our servers. Please note that all servers have the potential to be password locked for testing or private sessions without an announcement. We now have an official Discord that you can join by clicking <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/9RGdUS2">here.</a></p>

                            <li>Garry's Mod CityRP (Plays like the default DarkRP gamemode but more advanced and takes place in a modern city environment. Rules are similar to those seen on Lawless RP servers.)</li>
