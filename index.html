			<h2>About Us:</h2>
			<p>We are a small gaming community that started out in 2015 as just a group of friends who used to play on a bunch of different Garry's Mod servers, and came together to form this community because we wanted to do things our own way.</p><p>We started out with making our own Garry's Mod sandbox server that we based off of a now defunct server that some of us used to play on, but got fed up with the server's administration and the rules they enforced. After that, we ended up making a CityRP server and a Black Mesa RP server for the same reason. Black Mesa RP eventually evolved into Half-Life Universe RP, a unique combination of BMRP and HL2RP that goes through all major events of the Half-Life story. Throughout the years, we have also created many other servers including several Minecraft servers featuring our own selections of mods, and our Garry's Mod Various Gamemodes server, which is another unique server that hosts several gamemodes that can be switched to immediately if enough players request it. The way we host servers is a little different from most communities. We usually host based on community requests and have sessions that last a few hours on average, and many of our servers were built around this concept. Sometimes the servers we host are public, and sometimes they are restricted to community members and friends of community members only.</p><p>Recently, OPGman, the owner, has been working toward making the community open to more than just people interested in the games we play. As a big supporter of open source, he is interested in what community members are making. If you are a member and have a project you want to share with the rest of the community, let OP know, and he will give you your own page on this site. The projects you are working on do not necessarily have to be programming-related. It can be any creative work!</p><p>If you are interested in joining us, we recommend joining our <a href="https://discord.gg/9RGdUS2">Discord</a>, as it is the platform we are currently most active on. We also have a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/lambdaG">Steam group</a>, but it is not used much anymore. We are a very laid-back, non-serious, and friendly community, so come join us!</p>
