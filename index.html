			<h1>About Us:</h1>
			<p>We are a small gaming community mainly composed of a group of friends who used to play on a bunch of different Garry's Mod servers and came together to form this community.<br><br>We occasionally host our own game servers, some of which contain a lot of custom content created by the owner, OP AKA Source 2 Gman. Most of this custom content is open source and can be found <a href="https://github.com/LambdaGaming">here.</a><br><br>We do not run our servers 24/7. Instead, we open servers based on requests and have play sessions with community members that last a few hours on average.<br><br>We are mostly active on our <a href="https://discord.gg/9RGdUS2">Discord</a> where we talk about games, game modding, programming, etc. This is also where we announce server openings. Come join us!
			<br>
			<br>
			<h1>Our Main Servers:</h1>
			<p>There are many more games and servers we play on but these are the ones we play on the most.</p>
			<div class="list">
				<ul>
					<li><b>Garry's Mod CityRP</b> - Plays like the default DarkRP gamemode but more in-depth and takes place in a modern city environment. Rules are similar to those seen on Lawless RP servers.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Garry's Mod Half-Life Universe RP</b> - This is our custom gamemode based on the major events of the full Half-Life storyline. It is divided up into 3 sections: Black Mesa RP, City 17 RP, and Outland RP. The transition to each section is controlled by the players. More info about this server can be found <a href="https://lambdagaming.github.io/hlurp/about.html">here.</a></li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Garry's Mod Sandbox</b> - Simple sandbox server with many addons and maps, and few rules. Addons can be added or removed if enough players request it.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Garry's Mod Various Gamemodes</b> - Contains a wide variety of gamemodes and maps that can be switched on the fly if enough players request it. The current list of gamemodes on this server can be found <a href="https://lambdagaming.github.io/various/main.html">here.</a></li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Minecraft Vanilla</b> - Always runs the latest release version of the game. Runs multiple maps that can be switched to at the community's request.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Minecraft Modded</b> - Normal survival with basic rules. Has around 50 mods with a single map on version 1.12.2. Mods are no longer added or removed on this server to avoid corrupting parts of the map.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Minecraft Modded Unbalanced</b> - Normal survival with little rules. Has around 60 mods that were rejected from the other servers. Runs a single map on version 1.12.2. Mods are no longer added or removed on this server to avoid corrupting parts of the map.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Minecraft Modded Unbalanced 2</b> - Same as Unbalanced but with different mods, a new map, and more straight-forward rules. Runs on version 1.12.2.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Minecraft Modded Earth</b> - Runs the 1:1 scale Earth mod along with a few other mods. Players are allowed to use creative mode and admin commands to build their bases and explore but if they want to fight another player they are restricted to survival mode without admin commands.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Minecraft Modded RLCraft</b> - Runs the most recent version of the RLCraft modpack on a single map.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>SCP: Secret Laboratory</b> - Frequently updated with different server plugins (including a few custom ones) to keep the game interesting.</li>
