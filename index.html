			<h2>About Us:</h2>
			<p>We are a small gaming community that started out in 2015 as just a group of friends who used to play on a bunch of different Garry's Mod servers, and came together to form this community because we wanted to do things our own way.</p>
			<p>We started out making several Garry's Mod servers of our own, and eventually branched out to other games including Minecraft and SCP: Secret Laboratory. The way we host servers is a little different from most communities. We usually host based on community requests and have sessions that last a few hours on average, and many of our servers were built around this concept. Sometimes the servers we host are public, and sometimes they are restricted to community members only. If you are interesting in joining us next session, join our Discord to get notified about it.</p>
			<p>Recently, we've been moving toward making the community open to more than just people interested in the games we play. Many of our members do programming, game development, art, and more as a hobby. To help these members better engage with the community and show off what they're working on, we now offer two new ways to discuss and show off projects. One way is through the #waywo (What Are You Working On) channel in our Discord. Anyone can post here, even if they're new. The second way is through the Creators tab at the top of the page. Veteran members can link a portfolio or anything else they would like to show off here.</p>
