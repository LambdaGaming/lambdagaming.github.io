		<div class="main">
			<h1>About Us:</h1>
			<p>We are a small gaming community mainly composed of a group of friends who used to play on a bunch of different Garry's Mod servers and came together to form this community. We occasionally host our own game servers, most of which are for Garry's Mod and Minecraft. We do not run our servers 24/7.</a></p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h1>Our Main Servers:</h1>
			<p>These are the servers we actively play on and maintain. We have more than just these but they are rarely opened or updated, so they aren't worth mentioning here.</p>
			<div class="list">
				<ul>
					<li><b>Garry's Mod CityRP</b> - Plays like the default DarkRP gamemode but more in-depth and takes place in a modern city environment. Rules are similar to those seen on Lawless RP servers.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Garry's Mod Half-Life Universe RP</b> - This is our custom gamemode based on the major events of the full Half-Life storyline. It is divided up into 3 sections: Black Mesa RP, City 17 RP, and Outland RP. The transition to each section is controlled by the players.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Garry's Mod Sandbox</b> - Simple sandbox server with many addons and maps, and few rules. Addons can be added or removed if enough players request it.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Garry's Mod Various Gamemodes</b> - Contains a wide variety of gamemodes and maps that can be switched to on the fly. The current list of gamemodes on this server can be found <a href="https://lambdagaming.github.io/various/main.html">here.</a></li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Minecraft Vanilla</b> - Always runs the latest release version of the game. Runs multiple maps that can be switched to at the community's request.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Minecraft Modded</b> - Normal survival with basic rules. Has around 50 mods with a single map on version 1.12.2. Mods are no longer added or removed on this server to avoid corrupting parts of the map.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Minecraft Modded Unbalanced</b> - Normal survival with little rules. Has around 60 mods that were rejected from the other servers. Runs a single map on version 1.12.2. Mods are no longer added or removed on this server to avoid corrupting parts of the map.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Minecraft Modded Unbalanced 2</b> - Same as Unbalanced but with different mods, a new map, and more straight-forward rules. Runs on version 1.12.2.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Minecraft Modded Earth</b> - Runs the 1:1 scale Earth mod along with a few other mods. Players are allowed to use creative mode and teleport to build their bases but if they want to go to war with another player they can't use any of those features.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Minecraft Modded RLCraft</b> - Runs the most recent version of the RLCraft modpack on a single map.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>SCP: Secret Laboratory</b> - Frequently updated with different server plugins (including a few custom ones) to keep the game interesting.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<h1>Planned Servers:</h1>
			<p>These servers are in development and are not complete. They are usually restricted to developers and play testers.</p>
			<div class="list">
				<ul>
					<li><b>S&Box CityRP 2</b> - Complete redesign of our Gmod CityRP server. It will include new jobs, events, and activities that focus more on the roleplay side of things rather than the gunplay.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>S&Box Half-Life Universe RP 2</b> - Remake of our Gmod HLU RP server in S&Box. More details about this server come out once CityRP 2 is near completion.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>S&Box Sandbox</b> - Pretty much the same as our Gmod sandbox server. Will probably run Facepunch's sandbox gamemode unless a better one comes out.</li>
				</ul>
