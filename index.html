			<h1>About Us:</h1>
			<p>We are a small gaming community mainly composed of a group of friends who used to play on a bunch of different Garry's Mod servers and came together to form this community.<br><br>We occasionally host our own game servers, some of which contain a lot of custom content created by the owner, OP. Most of this custom content is open source and can be found <a href="https://github.com/LambdaGaming">here.</a><br><br>We do not run our servers 24/7. Instead, we open servers based on requests and have play sessions with community members that last a few hours on average.<br><br>We are mostly active on our <a href="https://discord.gg/9RGdUS2">Discord</a> where we talk about games, game modding, programming, etc. This is also where we announce server openings. Come join us!
			<br>
			<br>
			<h1>Our Main Servers:</h1>
			<p>There are many more games and servers we play on but these are the most popular.</p>
			<div class="list">
				<ul>
					<li><b>Garry's Mod CityRP</b> - This is kind of like a more realistic and in-depth version of DarkRP with several unique features. Rules are focused on being semi-serious and are similar to those seen on Lawless RP servers. Players have a lot of freedom when it comes to how they want to play. For example, most crimes can be committed by any job, and players are able to buy properties and save items on those properties across sessions. More info can be found <a href="cityrp/about.html">here.</a></li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Garry's Mod Half-Life Universe RP</b> - This is our custom gamemode based on the major events of the full Half-Life storyline. It is divided up into 3 sections: Black Mesa RP, City 17 RP, and Outland RP. The transition to each section is controlled by the players. More info can be found <a href="https://lambdagaming.github.io/hlurp/about.html">here.</a></li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Garry's Mod Sandbox</b> - Simple sandbox server with many addons and maps, and no rules outside of the general community ones. Addons are added and removed based on community requests.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Garry's Mod Various Gamemodes</b> - Contains a wide variety of gamemodes and maps that can be immediately switched to if enough players request it. The current gamemodes include Cops and Runners, Darkest Days, Dropzone, Flood, Homicide, Jazztronauts, Prop Hunt (original version), Pirate Ship Wars Remix, Sledbuild, Stop it, Slender!, TTT (with extra weapons), Trash Compactor, and Zombie Survival (2016 version).</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Minecraft Vanilla</b> - Always runs the latest release version of the game. Runs multiple maps that can be switched to at the community's request.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Minecraft Modded</b> - Normal survival with basic rules. Has around 50 mods with a single map on version 1.12.2.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Minecraft Modded 2</b> - Modernized sequel to the first modded server. Has over 50 mods with a single map on version 1.19.2.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Minecraft Modded Unbalanced</b> - Normal survival with little rules. Has around 60 mods that were rejected from the other servers. Runs a single map on version 1.12.2.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Minecraft Modded Unbalanced 2</b> - Same as Unbalanced but with different mods, a new map, and more straight-forward rules. Runs on version 1.12.2.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>SCP: Secret Laboratory</b> - Frequently updated with different server plugins (including several custom ones) to keep the game interesting.</li>
